# LD Dynamic Operator Closure

## 1) Purpose
Defines **closure rules** for Dynamics so LD/LDSF/LDF transformations remain:
- mathematically closed
- physically interpretable (when in LD)
- empirically anchorable
- non-metaphysical

Additive only.

---

## 2) Reference-only constraint
All dynamic behavior is **constrained by the Self Equation (⧖)** as sealed in UDC.
This document does not restate or modify it.

---

## 3) Dynamic state space
$$
x(t) \in \mathcal{X}
$$
$\mathcal{X}$ contains admissible LD-layer state representations that are measurable or inferable.

---

## 4) Operator closure set
Admissible operator set:
$$
\mathcal{O}=\{\tau,\Sigma,\mu\}
$$
Operators are mappings, not forces.

---

## 5) Closure axiom
$$
\forall x(t)\in\mathcal{X},\;\forall o\in\mathcal{O}:\quad o(x(t))\in\mathcal{X}
$$
No operator may yield undefined/non-admissible state.

---

## 6) LD / LDSF / LDF transition discipline
Three dynamic lane families:
- **LD** — local-domain physical/measurable evolution
- **LDSF** — expression/symbol-field constraints on LD outputs
- **LDF** — interior/functional meaning dynamics built on retained states

Monotonic discipline:
$$
LD \Rightarrow LDSF \Rightarrow LDF
$$

Reverse transitions require explicit measurable projection:
$$
\neg(LDF \Rightarrow LD)\quad \text{without defined projection }P
$$

---

## 7) Dimensional non-leakage (causal guard)
If higher-layer representation $y(t)$ is projected into LD:
$$
x_{LD}(t)=P(y(t))
$$
then LD evolution must be mechanism-grounded:
$$
x_{LD}(t+\Delta t)=M(x_{LD}(t),u(t))
$$
No symbolic construct may inject causality into LD without mechanism.

---

## 8) Recursive stability requirements
For recursion:
$$
x_{k+1}=F(x_k)
$$

### 8.1 Boundedness
$$
\exists B:\;\|x_k\|\le B\;\forall k
$$

### 8.2 Convergence or controlled cycling
$$
\lim_{k\to\infty}x_k\ \text{exists or enters a bounded cycle}
$$

### 8.3 Memory preservation
$$
\mu_{t+1}\supseteq \text{Preserve}(\mu_t)
$$
Overwrite without preservation is disallowed.

---

## 9) Operator role constraints (non-negotiable)

| Token | Allowed role | Forbidden role |
|:--|:--|:--|
| τ | measured delay / integration | instantaneous causation |
| Σ | encoding / abstraction | physical force/law |
| μ | retention / persistence | recall without storage |
| ⊙ | state finalization marker | ontological creation |
| ⊕ | defined union across states | provenance erasure |

---

## 10) Empirical anchors (minimum)
At least one anchor required for dynamic validity claims:
- τ: measured latency
- Σ: encoding/compression metrics
- μ: retention/persistence metrics

No anchors → **formal-only** label.

---

## 11) Falsifiers
Closure fails if:
1) operator yields undefined state  
2) sustained τ=0 is claimed as valid dynamics  
3) memory claimed without persistence  
4) downward causation occurs without mechanism  
5) recursion diverges without containment
