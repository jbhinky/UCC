# LD2 Cross-Method Concordance — Operator Spec (v2.5.1)

## Required Header (Filled)
- **Operator Name:** LD2 Cross-Method Concordance  
- **Tier Scope:** LD2 (integrated systems)  
- **Inputs:** outputs from multiple independent measurement or estimation methods  
- **Outputs:** concordance metrics, disagreement flags, comparison manifest  
- **Allowed Datasets:** independently produced LD outputs with full provenance  
- **Disallowed Inputs:** forced averaging, narrative reconciliation, authority weighting  

---

## 1) Operational Role
Assess whether **independent methods agree within uncertainty bounds**.
This operator **does not merge results**; it evaluates compatibility only.

---

## 2) Mathematical / Algorithmic Form

For estimates \(\hat{\theta}_a, \hat{\theta}_b\) with covariances \(C_a, C_b\):

$$
\Delta = \hat{\theta}_a - \hat{\theta}_b
$$

Concordance test:
$$
\chi^2 = \Delta^\top (C_a + C_b)^{-1} \Delta
$$

Agreement declared only if \(\chi^2 \le \chi^2_{\alpha}\).

---

## 3) Uncertainty Handling (Required)
- **Types:** propagated parameter covariance  
- **Propagation:** direct covariance sum  
- **Failure behavior:** missing covariance → `CONCORDANCE_UNDEFINED`

---

## 4) Validation Gate (Required)
1) methods declared independent  
2) uncertainty provided for each method  
3) concordance metric declared  
4) disagreement explicitly flagged  
5) falsifier defined  

---

## 5) Falsifier (Required)
Fails if:
- disagreement is hidden via averaging
- covariance is ignored
- methods share hidden dependencies
- agreement declared without uncertainty

---

## 6) Boundary Conditions
- **LD-only**
- no synthesis into higher layers
- no continuity routing
