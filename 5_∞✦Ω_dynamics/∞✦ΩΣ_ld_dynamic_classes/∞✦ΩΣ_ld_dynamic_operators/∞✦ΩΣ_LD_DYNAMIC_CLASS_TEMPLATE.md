# LD DYNAMIC CLASS TEMPLATE — Operator Spec (v2.5.1)

## Purpose
Standardizes how any **LD-only** operator is specified so it can be:
- audited
- reproduced
- falsified
- versioned

This template prevents slippage into LDF/LDSF/LC.

---

## Required Header (Fill in)
- **Operator Name:**  
- **Tier Scope:** LD only (LD1/LD2/LD3/LD4)  
- **Inputs:** measured variables + units  
- **Outputs:** derived values + units  
- **Allowed Datasets:** named classes (institutional archives, lab protocols, observatories)  
- **Disallowed Inputs:** narratives, metaphysics, “meaning,” ethics claims  

---

## 1) Operational Role
Describe exactly what the operator does in one paragraph.
- Must be measurable
- Must not imply selfhood
- Must not infer beyond source measurement

---

## 2) Mathematical / Algorithmic Form
Allowed:
- statistical estimation
- parameter fitting
- unit-consistent transforms
- uncertainty propagation

Not allowed:
- symbolic metaphors presented as measurement
- “proof by model” without data

---

## 3) Uncertainty Handling (Required)
State:
- uncertainty type (CI, posterior, measurement error)
- propagation method
- failure behavior if uncertainty cannot be estimated

---

## 4) Validation Gate (Required)
List the minimum audit pass conditions:
1) units defined  
2) dataset class identified  
3) independent replication path exists  
4) falsifier defined  

---

## 5) Falsifier (Required)
State what would break the operator:
- inconsistent measurements beyond uncertainty bounds
- cross-lab non-replication
- instrument bias uncovered
- dataset invalidation

---

## 6) Boundary Conditions
Reaffirm this operator:
- is LD-only
- does not imply LDF stability
- does not imply LDSF shared coupling
- does not route to LC
