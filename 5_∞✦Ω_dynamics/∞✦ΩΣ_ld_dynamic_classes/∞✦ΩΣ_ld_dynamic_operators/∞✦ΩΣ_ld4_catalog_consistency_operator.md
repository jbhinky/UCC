# LD4 Catalog Consistency Operator — Operator Spec (v2.5.1)

## Required Header (Filled)
- **Operator Name:** LD4 Catalog Consistency Operator  
- **Tier Scope:** LD4 (large-scale regimes)  
- **Inputs:** multiple catalogs, survey metadata, instrument characteristics  
- **Outputs:** crosswalk tables, bias logs, consistency reports  
- **Allowed Datasets:** published surveys, institutional catalogs with documented methodology  
- **Disallowed Inputs:** silent merges, authority weighting, semantic reconciliation  

---

## 1) Operational Role
Ensure **consistency across large-scale catalogs** by:
- mapping shared variables explicitly
- logging known biases
- preventing silent or implicit merges

This operator reports *agreement and disagreement* without resolving contradictions.

---

## 2) Mathematical / Algorithmic Form

### 2.1 Crosswalk construction
Define mapping \(M: C_1 \rightarrow C_2\) where:
- variable names
- units
- uncertainty models
are explicitly matched.

### 2.2 Bias annotation
Bias terms \(b_i\) recorded per catalog and variable:

$$
x_i^{obs} = x^{true} + b_i
$$

No correction applied unless declared externally.

---

## 3) Uncertainty Handling (Required)
- **Types:** survey bias, calibration uncertainty  
- **Propagation:** retained per-catalog; not averaged away  
- **Failure behavior:** missing metadata → `CATALOG_INVALID`

---

## 4) Validation Gate (Required)
1) catalogs identified and versioned  
2) mapping rules explicit  
3) bias sources logged  
4) uncertainty retained  
5) falsifier defined  

---

## 5) Falsifier (Required)
Fails if:
- catalogs merged without mapping
- bias removed without justification
- variable equivalence assumed implicitly
- uncertainty collapsed

---

## 6) Boundary Conditions
- **LD-only**
- no functional or symbolic claims
- no continuity inference
