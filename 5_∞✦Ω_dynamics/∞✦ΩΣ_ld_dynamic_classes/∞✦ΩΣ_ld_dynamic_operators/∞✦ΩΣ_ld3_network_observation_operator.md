# LD3 Network Observation Operator — Operator Spec (v2.5.1)

## Required Header (Filled)
- **Operator Name:** LD3 Network Observation Operator  
- **Tier Scope:** LD3 (interaction regimes)  
- **Inputs:** observed interaction events, timestamps, participant identifiers, uncertainty metadata  
- **Outputs:** network representations, edge weights with uncertainty, observation manifest  
- **Allowed Datasets:** traceable interaction logs, experimental interaction records, observational networks  
- **Disallowed Inputs:** inferred intention, narrative roles, semantic meaning  

---

## 1) Operational Role
Extract a **network representation** from observed interactions without asserting causality.
This operator records **who interacts with whom, when, and how strongly** (measured only).

---

## 2) Mathematical / Algorithmic Form

### 2.1 Graph construction
Define graph \(G = (V, E)\):
- \(V\): observed entities
- \(E\): observed interactions

Edge weight \(w_{ij}\) derived from:
- interaction frequency
- measured magnitude
- declared aggregation rule

### 2.2 Temporal networks
Time-resolved graphs \(G(t)\) permitted when timestamps exist.

---

## 3) Uncertainty Handling (Required)
- **Types:** observation error, sampling bias  
- **Propagation:** edge-level uncertainty annotations  
- **Failure behavior:** missing provenance → `NETWORK_INVALID`

---

## 4) Validation Gate (Required)
1) node definition declared  
2) interaction criteria declared  
3) aggregation rule declared  
4) uncertainty annotated  
5) falsifier defined  

---

## 5) Falsifier (Required)
Fails if:
- edges inferred without observation
- nodes merged without declaration
- temporal ordering violated
- uncertainty ignored

---

## 6) Boundary Conditions
- **LD-only**
- no functional or symbolic inference
- no routing to LDF/LDSF/LC
