# LD OPERATOR INDEX — LD1–LD4 (v2.5.1)

## Purpose
Defines the **minimum operator classes** expected for LD processing, without implementing code.

This file is an index and governance map.  
Each operator must have its own spec file based on `LD_DYNAMIC_CLASS_TEMPLATE.md`.

---

## LD1 Operators (Microstructure)
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld1_unit_normalizer.md` — unit normalization and instrument reference consistency  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld1_spectral_fit_operator.md` — spectral line fit + uncertainty propagation  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld1_noise_floor_estimator.md` — measurement noise + detection thresholds  

## LD2 Operators (Integrated Systems)
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld2_time_series_assimilator.md` — resampling, missingness, uncertainty-aware aggregation  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld2_parameter_estimator.md` — fit measurable system parameters (with confidence bounds)  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld2_cross_method_concordance.md` — reconcile multiple measurement methods without merging contradictions  

## LD3 Operators (Interaction Regimes)
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld3_effect_size_operator.md` — effect size estimation (interaction coupling, measurable only)  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld3_network_observation_operator.md` — observational network extraction with protocol traceability  

## LD4 Operators (Large-Scale Regimes)
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld4_scale_transition_operator.md` — scaling transformations that preserve units + uncertainty  
- `∞✦ΩΣ_ld4_catalog_consistency_operator.md` — cross-survey crosswalks, bias logging, no silent merges  

---

## Non-Negotiable Policy
- LD operators must never claim LDF or LDSF status.
- If field regularity is required, route to `dynamic_continuity/` gates.
