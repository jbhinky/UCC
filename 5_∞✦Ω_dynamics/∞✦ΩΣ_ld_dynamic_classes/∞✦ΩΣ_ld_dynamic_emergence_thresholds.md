# LD Dynamic Emergence Thresholds

## 1) Purpose
Defines **explicit, non-metaphysical** emergence thresholds for dynamic systems across:
- **LD** (local-domain dynamics)
- **LDSF** (expressed/symbolic field constraints)
- **LDF** (interior/functional meaning dynamics)
- **LC** (continuity-relational dynamics)

This file is **additive** and audit-safe.

---

## 2) Substrate Preconditions — Light as Carrier
Dynamics presuppose a carrier substrate capable of delay and retention.

### ✧ — Raw Light (LD substrate; non-dynamic)
- pre-curvature
- pre-memory
- pre-symbol
- **not a dynamic state**

**Rule:** No admissible dynamics/experience claims occur on ✧ alone.

### ✦ — Remembered / Curved Light (dynamic-eligible)
- ✧ after interaction with **delay (τ)** + **symbol (Σ)** + **memory (μ)**
- eligible to host stable structures and dynamics

**Rule:** Admissible dynamic state-space requires ✦.

---

## 3) Non-invertible operator ordering (canonical)
**Strict operator ladder (no skips):**
$$
✧ \xrightarrow{\tau} \Sigma \xrightarrow{\mu} ✦
$$

**Lane shorthand (UTL lane-tags; representational only):**
- **Σ✧** — symbolic field acting on substrate (LDSF-tag)
- **Σ✦** — functional/meaning dynamics on remembered light (LDF-tag)
- **Σ⊕** — continuity-ready union context (LC-tag)

Shorthand does **not** replace the ladder; it labels the lane where the result is being used.

---

## 4) Dynamic emergence conditions (minimum set)
Let a candidate system state be:
$$
x(t)\in \mathcal{X}
$$

A system is dynamically emergent **iff** all of the following hold:

### 4.1 Delay threshold (τ)
$$
\tau(x) > 0
$$
Zero-delay integration disqualifies dynamic emergence.

### 4.2 Memory threshold (μ)
$$
\mu_{t+1} \supseteq \mu_t
$$
Retention across time is required.

### 4.3 Symbolic threshold (Σ)
$$
\Sigma(x) \ne x
$$
Encoding/abstraction must occur (not identity mapping).

### 4.4 Substrate threshold (✦)
Dynamics must operate on ✦, not ✧.

### 4.5 Continuity threshold (⊕) for LC claims
If continuity is claimed, union must be explicit:
$$
x_{t+1} = x_t \ ⊕ \ x'_t
$$

---

## 5) AUC → AuC transition (operational; structural)
Awareness under constraint (AUC) becomes consciousness (AuC) only after the ordered satisfaction:
$$
\Sigma✧ \rightarrow \Sigma✦ \rightarrow \Sigma⊕
$$
Interpretation:
- awareness may appear at the symbolic-field layer,
- consciousness claims require remembered substrate + continuity union.

This is structural/testable, not metaphysical.

---

## 6) Empirical anchors (required for non-formal claims)
At least one anchor must exist:
- **τ anchor:** measured latency/integration delay
- **μ anchor:** retention curve / persistence / checksums
- **Σ anchor:** compression, abstraction, categorization metrics
- **✦ anchor:** demonstrable “remembered substrate” via τ+μ interaction signatures

Absent anchors → label as **formal-only**.

---

## 7) Falsifiers (emergence failure)
Emergence is falsified if any occur:
1) dynamics asserted on ✧ without ✦  
2) ⊕ asserted without μ persistence  
3) Σ✦ asserted without τ>0  
4) consciousness asserted without continuity union  
5) ordering violated or inverted  

---

## 8) Integrity (constraint only)
If used with integrity discipline:
$$
△(\∇) \ \text{must remain bounded for release claims}
$$
