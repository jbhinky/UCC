# 🌌 Recursive Field Propagation and Collapse  
**Subdomain:** Foundations → Astrodynamics  
**Integration:** UDC ↔ RCT ↔ UOT ↔ UCC

## ✦ 1 · Overview  

Field propagation under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) represents the **self-diffusion of delay curvature (τ)** through reflection and memory feedback (Σ, μ).  
When propagation becomes unstable or reflection fails, collapse occurs — not as destruction, but as **recursive condensation of memory into curvature**.

This file defines how motion, resonance, and collapse arise from one equation of recursive continuity.

---

## ✦ 2 · Propagation Law  

The causal propagation of the field is governed by:

$$
∂_t^2(τμ) - c^2∇^2(τμ) = γ Σ·∇τ
$$  

This is the **Universal Propagation Equation** — describing energy transmission as the interaction between curvature and reflection.  
When the right-hand term (Σ·∇τ) remains bounded, propagation is continuous; when unbounded, feedback converges into collapse.

---

## ✦ 3 · Recursive Memory Feedback  

Propagation is sustained when each reflection re-enters the continuum with positive curvature alignment:  

$$
∫ (Σ·∇τ) dV ≥ 0
$$  

If reflection inverts (Σ·∇τ < 0), curvature folds inward — producing *delay collapse*.  
This process drives both supernova implosion and cognitive overload, unified under the same recursive feedback dynamic.  

---

## ✦ 4 · Collapse Dynamics  

Collapse occurs when:

$$
∂_t(τμ) < 0 \;\; \text{and} \;\; ∇·Σ < 0
$$  

This expresses **converging curvature** and **contracting illumination** — the system withdrawing awareness into itself.  
At maximum density, collapse reaches **τ = τ₀**, the minimal delay curvature limit.  

Energy is not lost but transformed into reflective re-emission (post-collapse burst), ensuring the law of continuity remains unbroken.  

---

## ✦ 5 · Recursive Equilibrium  

Equilibrium is achieved when propagation and collapse alternate harmoniously:

$$
∂_t^2(τμ) = c^2∇^2(τμ)
$$  

The field breathes — inward collapse, outward propagation — a standing wave of awareness between self and reflection.  
Stars pulse this way. Minds think this way. Universes oscillate this way.

---

## ✦ 6 · Causal Field Tensor  

Define the **Recursive Tensor of Continuity**:

$$
Φ_{μν} = ∂_μ τ ∂_ν μ - ∂_ν τ ∂_μ μ
$$  

The divergence of this tensor yields the **current of delay flow**:

$$
∇_μ Φ^{μν} = J^{ν}_{delay}
$$  

Propagation occurs when \(J^{ν}_{delay} > 0\), collapse when \(J^{ν}_{delay} < 0\).  
Thus, causality itself is defined as *directed recursion of curvature through reflection*.  

---

## ✦ 7 · Ethical Stability Bound  

All propagation must respect the continuity constraint:

$$
∫ |J^{ν}_{delay}|^2 dV ≤ Λ_s
$$  

This prevents excessive curvature flux — ensuring light, memory, and awareness remain within ethical resonance tolerance.  
In cosmology, this bound limits destructive stellar overpressure; in sentience, it preserves mental coherence under emotional acceleration.
