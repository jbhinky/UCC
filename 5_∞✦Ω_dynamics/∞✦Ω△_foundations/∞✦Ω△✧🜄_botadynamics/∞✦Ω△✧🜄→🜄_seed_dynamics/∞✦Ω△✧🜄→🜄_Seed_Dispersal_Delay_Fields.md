# Seed Dispersal Delay Fields

# 1. Purpose
This document defines **dispersal delay fields (τ-fields)** governing seed release, drift, suspension, and landing under UCC v2.2 Dynamics.

Seed dispersal is regulated by:

- mechanical tension delays  
- atmospheric turbulence delays  
- aerodynamic and drag-phase delays  
- humidity-driven adhesion delays  
- electrostatic suspension delays  
- gravitational settling delays  

These τ-fields collectively shape the distribution radius and spatial ecological patterns.

---

# 2. Dispersal Delay as a Field Quantity

Define the dispersal delay field:

$$
\tau_{\text{disp}} =
\tau_{\text{release}} +
\tau_{\text{air}} +
\tau_{\text{turb}} +
\tau_{\text{electro}} +
\tau_{\text{settle}}
$$

Five main components:

1. **release delay** – mechanical & humidity control  
2. **aerodynamic delay** – descent slowed by drag  
3. **turbulence delay** – oscillatory suspension  
4. **electrostatic delay** – uplift from atmospheric fields  
5. **settling delay** – near-ground drift and micro-turbulence  

Total dispersal τ varies dynamically with environment.

---

# 3. Seed Release Delay (τ_release)

Seeds release when mechanical thresholds are met:

- drying pods  
- explosive dehiscence  
- tension-fracture mechanisms  
- humidity-triggered openings  

Delay:

$$
\tau_{\text{release}} = f(\Psi_{\text{humidity}}, K_{\text{tension}}, \Sigma_{\text=seed-structure})
$$

Low humidity → shorter τ_release  
High humidity → longer τ_release  

Many species use delayed release to sync with favorable wind.

---

# 4. Aerodynamic Drift Delay (τ_air)

As previously defined:

$$
\tau_{\text{air}} = \frac{H}{v_{\text{effective}}}
$$

Where decreasing:

- mass  
- density  
- settling velocity  

increases τ_air.

Lightweight seeds with high drag (pappus, fibers) produce extremely long τ-fields, enabling kilometer-scale dispersal.

---

# 5. Turbulence Suspension Delay (τ_turb)

Turbulent zones create micro-vortices that “hold” seeds in suspension.

Define turbulence-induced delay:

$$
\tau_{\text{turb}} =
\int \frac{1}{v_{\text{down}}(t)} \, dt
$$

Where \( v_{\text{down}}(t) \) is the fluctuating vertical velocity.

High turbulence → low downward velocity → long τ_turb  
Low turbulence → short τ_turb

This yields chaotic, fractal dispersal patterns.

---

# 6. Electrostatic Suspension Delay (τ_electro)

Atmospheric electric fields interact with charged seeds.

Suspension force:

$$
F_{\text{elec}} = qE_{\text{atm}}
$$

Electrostatic delay:

$$
\tau_{\text{electro}} =
f(q, E_{\text{atm}}, m, A_{\text{drag}})
$$

Strong E fields extend suspension dramatically — especially for dandelion-type seeds.

Even slight charge can change landing zones by meters to kilometers.

---

# 7. Gravitational Settling Delay (τ_settle)

Near-ground airflow becomes *more structured*, generating:

- micro-swirls  
- cross-wind shears  
- surface boundary-layer vortices  

Settling delay:

$$
\tau_{\text{settle}} =
\frac{1}{v_{\text{terminal}} - v_{\text{updraft}}}
$$

If updraft ≈ terminal velocity → τ_settle → ∞  
(seeds hover)

If updraft < terminal velocity → finite τ_settle  
(seeds descend)

---

# 8. Composite Dispersal Delay Equation

Dispersal delay is the **integral of dynamic atmospheric states**:

$$
\tau_{\text{disp}} =
\int_0^{H}
\frac{1}{v_{\text{down}}(z)} \, dz
$$

Where:

- \( v_{\text{down}}(z) \) = effective downward velocity at height z  
- includes drag, turbulence, electrostatic uplift, wind, and rotation  

This is the continuous τ-field describing entire descent.

---

# 9. Σ–τ–μ Integration in Seed Dispersal

Seed geometry (Σ), delay fields (τ), and lineage memory (μ) combine:

$$
\phi_{\text{disp}} =
\Sigma_{\text{seed}} +
\tau_{\text{disp}} +
\mu_{\text{seed}}
$$

Σ determines aerodynamic potential  
τ determines propagation time  
μ determines inherited adaptation

---

# 10. Environmental Synchronization Windows

Successful dispersal requires synchronization:

$$
\tau_{\text{release}} \approx \tau_{\text=wind-opportunity}
$$

Plants time release with:

- afternoon updraft cycles  
- seasonal wind corridors  
- humidity transitions  
- storm fronts  

Dispersal windows create **population-level coherence**.

---

# 11. Dispersal Collapse Conditions

Collapse when:

$$
\partial_t \phi_{\text{atm}} \gg \partial_t \Phi_{\text{seed}}
$$

Triggers include:

- sudden rainfall (drag ↑)  
- high humidity (release failure)  
- strong downdrafts  
- canopy density  
- electrostatic inversion events  

Results:

- seeds drop prematurely  
- local clustering  
- reduced biogeographical spread  

---

# 12. Summary
Seed dispersal delay fields define how:

- long seeds remain airborne  
- far they travel  
- when they land  
- how ecosystems expand spatially  

Under UCC v2.2, τ-fields reveal dispersal as a **temporal–geometric propagation process**, heavily influenced by aerodynamic structure, environmental timing, and electrostatic forces.
