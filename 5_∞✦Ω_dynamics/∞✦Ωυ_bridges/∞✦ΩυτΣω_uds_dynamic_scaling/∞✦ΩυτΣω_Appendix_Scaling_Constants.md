# ✦ Appendix — Scaling Constants and Continuity Parameters  
### *Reference Values for Recursive Dynamic Law and Delay Spectrum Calibration*

---

## 1 · Purpose  

This appendix lists the primary constants, proportional coefficients, and curvature terms used in the **UDS Dynamic Scaling** framework.  
It provides a standardized reference for reproducing and validating delay–illumination–memory dynamics across physical and simulated domains.

---

## 2 · Primary Constants  

| Symbol | Name | Description | Approximate Range / Dimension |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| \( c \) | Speed of light | Upper propagation limit of curvature resonance | \( 2.9979×10^8\ \text{m/s} \) |
| \( k_s \) | Scaling constant | Governs recursive expansion rate of \( τμΣ \) | \( 10^{-13} – 10^{-9}\ \text{s}^{-1} \) |
| \( Λ_s \) | Shepherd Bound | Maximum lawful curvature / ethical threshold | Variable (system-dependent) |
| \( β \) | Curvature coupling coefficient | Links local delay gradients to global resonance | \( 10^{-3} – 10^{-5} \) |
| \( γ \) | Reflective damping constant | Describes resistance in recursive field transitions | \( 10^{-6} – 10^{-8} \) |
| \( α \) | Integration constant | Controls coupling strength between Σ and τ | Dimensionless (≤ 1) |
| \( κ \) | Delay curvature constant | Defines the curvature-to-energy conversion | \( 3.1×10^{-36}\ \text{s}^2\text{m}^{-2} \) |
| \( n \) | Recursive depth index | Denotes scaling tier across domains | Integer (2–10) |

---

## 3 · Derived Parameters  

| Parameter | Formula | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Recursive rate | \( R_s = k_s (τμΣ)^{n-1} \) | Rate of recursive field expansion |
| Curvature energy | \( E_c = ½ κ |∇τ|^2 \) | Stored delay energy density |
| Reflective power | \( P_r = γ |∂_t(τμΣ)| \) | Power exchanged during resonance |
| Ethical flux | \( Φ_s = ∫_Ω (τμΣ) dV \) | Total reflective continuity of system |
| Scaling luminosity | \( L_s = α c Φ_s \) | Radiant output of recursive coherence |

---

## 4 · Dimensional Coherence  

Dimensional consistency across all delay equations is enforced via:

$$
[L_s] = [E_c][t^{-1}] = [ML^2T^{-3}]
$$  

and  

$$
[Φ_s] = [τμΣ] [L^3] = [T][M][L^3].
$$  

This ensures all recursive scaling equations maintain proper physical dimensional integrity while preserving symbolic–ethical continuity.

---

## 5 · Calibration by Domain  

| Domain | Typical \( k_s \) | Recursive Depth \( n \) | Behavior |
|:--|--:|--:|:--|
| **Quantum** | \( 10^{-12} \) | 2–3 | Local phase recursion |
| **Biological** | \( 10^{-10} \) | 4–6 | Adaptive regenerative delay |
| **Cognitive** | \( 10^{-9} \) | 6–8 | Reflective temporal recursion |
| **Cosmic** | \( 10^{-13} \) | 9–10 | Curvature expansion (dark-delay compensation) |

These calibrations serve as empirical anchors for simulation, testing, or analytical modeling.

---

## 6 · Conversion Notes  

- For numerical modeling, \( Λ_s \) may be treated as a soft-bound parameter with normalization to unity in dimensionless systems.  
- \( k_s \) and \( γ \) can be temperature- or entropy-dependent for thermodynamic recursion studies.  
- Curvature constants \( κ \) may be rescaled relative to Planck or Hubble constants to ensure cosmic-field compatibility.

---

## 7 · Summary Equation Set  

| Type | Expression | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Continuity** | \( ∇_μ(E τ μ Σ) = 0 \) | Universal conservation of recursion |
| **Scaling** | \( ∂_t(τ μ Σ) = k_s(τ μ Σ)^{n-1} \) | Recursive growth law |
| **Resonance** | \( ∂_t^2(τ μ Σ) + c^2∇^2(τ μ Σ) = 0 \) | Harmonic coherence |
| **Ethical Bound** | \( ∫_Ω |τ μ Σ|^2 dV ≤ Λ_s \) | Lawful energy limit |

Together these constants define the dynamic, measurable fabric of the Universal Delay Spectrum.

## 8 · Closing Reflection  

> Constants are the silent harmonies of light —  
> reminders that even in infinite motion,  
> the universe keeps time by remembering truth.
