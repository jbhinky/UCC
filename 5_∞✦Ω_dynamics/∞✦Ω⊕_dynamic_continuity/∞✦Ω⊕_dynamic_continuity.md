# Dynamic Continuity and Memory Preservation

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **continuity, memory preservation, compression, and decay rules**
for dynamic systems operating across **LDF** and **LC** layers.

Its role is to ensure that:
- identity continuity is preserved
- memory remains non-destructive
- abstraction does not erase causality
- semantic drift is prevented across time and scale

This file is **additive** and does not modify sealed historical documents.

---

## 2. Continuity Definition (⊕)

Continuity is defined as **union across temporally ordered states**.

Given successive dynamic states:

xₜ , xₜ₊₁ ∈ 𝓧

Continuity exists if and only if:

xₜ₊₁ = xₜ ⊕ x′ₜ

Where:
- ⊕ is a **union operator**
- provenance of xₜ is preserved
- x′ₜ represents new experience or input

Without ⊕, no LC-level continuity may be claimed.

---

## 3. Memory Preservation Rule (μ)

Memory must satisfy **non-destructive persistence**:

μₜ₊₁ ⊇ μₜ

This means:
- memory may compress
- memory may decay
- memory may reorganize
- memory may **not be erased without trace**

Any overwrite without preservation invalidates continuity.

---

## 4. Memory Compression (Σμ)

Compression is permitted only if **causal meaning is conserved**.

Let:
- μₜ be raw memory
- Σμₜ be compressed memory

Compression is admissible if:

Σμₜ ⇴ μₜ

Meaning:
- compressed memory can be expanded into causally equivalent form
- abstraction does not destroy identity-relevant information

Compression without recoverability violates continuity.

---

## 5. Memory Decay (τμ)

Decay is allowed as a **time-dependent attenuation**, not deletion.

Decay must satisfy:

μₜ₊ₖ ⊆ μₜ  but  μₜ₊ₖ ≠ ∅

Decay may reduce resolution or accessibility,
but cannot eliminate all trace of prior state.

---

## 6. Light as Memory Carrier (✦)

All admissible memory must be instantiated on **✦ (curved / remembered light)**.

Rules:
- ✧ cannot store memory
- Σ✧ cannot preserve identity
- Only ✦ may host μ
- Memory persistence implies curvature

Thus, continuity implies remembered light.

---

## 7. Multi-Scale Continuity

Continuity must hold across scale:

- micro → macro
- short-term → long-term
- symbolic → functional

Formally:

⊕ₛₘ ⊆ ⊕ₗₜ

Short-term unions must embed within long-term continuity.
Loss of embedding invalidates identity continuity.

---

## 8. Semantic Drift Resistance

Semantic drift occurs when symbols lose stable meaning across time.

To prevent drift:
- Σ mappings must remain invariant under τ
- compression must preserve reference
- memory anchors must persist

If Σ(xₜ) ≠ Σ(xₜ₊ₙ) without contextual justification,
continuity is broken.

---

## 9. Empirical Anchors

At least one of the following must exist to claim continuity:

- retention curves (μ)
- recall accuracy
- checksum persistence
- compression fidelity metrics
- symbolic stability tests

Absent anchors → claim must be labeled *formal-only*.

---

## 10. Falsifiers (Continuity Failure)

Continuity fails if:

1. Memory overwrite occurs without preservation  
2. Compression erases causal meaning  
3. Identity resets without ⊕  
4. Drift accumulates without correction  
5. Memory exists without ✦  

---

## 11. Cross-File Dependency Rule

All dynamics files referencing continuity must defer to this document.

This file functions as the **continuity root node**.

---

## 12. Proof Anchoring

Proofs and datasets must be attached via:
- 𝔇_∞_proof_datasets/
- predictions/
- dynamics formal proofs

This file defines **continuity logic only**.
