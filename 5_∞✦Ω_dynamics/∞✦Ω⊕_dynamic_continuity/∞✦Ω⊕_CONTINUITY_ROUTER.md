# CONTINUITY ROUTER — Tier Transition Rules (v2.5.1)

## Purpose
Defines the **routing logic** that governs transitions and boundaries between:
- **LD** (Light Dimension)
- **LDF** (Light-Dimension Field)
- **LDSF** (Light-Dimension Shared Field)
- **LC** (Continuity Layer)

This is an **operator spec**. It does not define new science.

---

## 1) Tier Definitions (Operational)
- **LD:** measurable structure at a given scale without requiring shared field stability.
- **LDF:** measurable field regularities across populations/ecosystems/systems (shared statistical structure).
- **LDSF:** shared-field coupling across observers/agents where *shared* stability conditions are demonstrably met. *(Only LDSF1–LDSF4 treated as proven.)*
- **LC:** continuity routing layer (collapse/return/grounding) used for interfaith-only files and continuity semantics.

---

## 2) Allowed Transitions
### 2.1 Within-tier (always allowed)
- LDᵢ → LDᵢ (updates with new measurements)
- LDFᵢ → LDFᵢ
- LDSFᵢ → LDSFᵢ
- LC → LC

### 2.2 Up-tier (requires gate)
- LD → LDF requires: **field regularity evidence** + replicability + observer independence
- LDF → LDSF requires: **shared-field proof gates** (LDSF1–4 only)
- Any tier → LC requires: explicit **continuity purpose** and “interfaith-only” constraint, not scientific necessity

### 2.3 Down-tier (allowed on failure)
If LDF or LDSF gates fail under audit, downgrade is mandatory:
- LDSF → LDF
- LDF → LD

---

## 3) Gate Conditions (Hard Requirements)
### 3.1 LD → LDF Gate
Must provide:
1) measured variable families with units  
2) cross-lab or cross-site replication  
3) stable statistical structure over time/space  
4) falsifier  

### 3.2 LDF → LDSF Gate (Only LDSF1–LDSF4)
Must provide:
1) multi-agent or multi-observer coupling measurements  
2) shared stability / synchronization evidence (within uncertainty bounds)  
3) explicit rejection of unproven tiers (no LDSF5+)  
4) falsifier  

### 3.3 Any tier → LC Gate
Must provide:
1) interfaith-only intent statement  
2) explicit non-claim clause (no new physics)  
3) separation from scientific proofs (LC can cite, not replace)  

---

## 4) Failure Modes (Automatic Responses)
- Missing units or protocols → fail
- Missing dataset class → fail
- Missing falsifier → fail
- Any metaphysical claim in LD/LDF/LDSF → fail and route to LC folder (if needed) or remove

---

## 5) Implementation Notes (Folder Routing)
- LD operators live in: `ld_dynamic_classes/`
- Cross-tier routers and adapters live in: `dynamic_continuity/`
- Legacy mappings live only under: `.../legacy/`
