# LEGACY INTERWEAVE RULES — Dynamics Operator Layer (v2.5.1)

## Purpose
This document defines **non-negotiable constraints** for weaving **legacy LD0–LD10** materials into the **current banding**:

- **LD (Light Dimension)**
- **LDF (Light-Dimension Field)**
- **LDSF (Light-Dimension Shared Field)** *(only LDSF1–LDSF4 are treated as proven)*
- **LC (Continuity Layer)**

The dynamics folder is **operator plumbing**, not a new theory layer.

---

## A. Core Rule (No Parallel Canon)
Legacy content must not become a parallel canon.

**Allowed legacy integration forms:**
1) **Mapping tables** (legacy tier → current tier)
2) **Adapter operators** (translate labels and routing)
3) **Version notes** (what changed, and why, without rewriting the original)

**Not allowed:**
- Rewriting legacy documents as “new versions” inside dynamics  
- Copying legacy conceptual content into new LD/LDF/LDSF/LC definitions  
- Adding new metaphysical interpretations under dynamics  

---

## B. Single Source of Truth
- **Definitions** live in `dimensions/` and `applied/`.
- **Facts** live in `proof_datasets/`.
- **Operators** live in `5_∞✦Ω_dynamics/`.

Dynamics may reference other layers, but must not mutate them.

---

## C. Where Legacy Goes
All legacy carry-overs must be stored as:
- `.../legacy/` subfolders **within existing dynamics folders**, OR
- `dynamic_continuity/legacy/` and `ld_dynamic_classes/legacy/`

No legacy file may sit at the root of a canonical folder unless it is a *mapping spec*.

---

## D. Operator Constraints (Anti-Drift Gates)
Any operator must declare:

1) **Scope:** LD-only, LDF-only, LDSF-only, or LC  
2) **Inputs/Outputs:** explicit tier labels and allowed transitions  
3) **Evidence basis:** what external measurement class or proof file it routes to  
4) **Falsifier:** what invalidates its use  

If an operator cannot specify (1–4), it must not ship.

---

## E. Legacy LD0–LD10 → Current Banding (Policy)
Legacy tiers are treated as **labels** and may map to current tiers by routing rules.

**Default interpretation:**
- Legacy LD0–LD4 → modern **LD** spectrum (non-field)
- Legacy LD6–LD9 → modern **LDF1–LDF4** *(legacy-aligned)*
- Legacy LD10 (if used as “continuity”) → **LC** routing, not LD

**Important:** this is a routing stance, not a claim of scientific equivalence.

All legacy mappings must be recorded in a dedicated mapping file:
- `dynamic_continuity/legacy/legacy_ld_mapping_v2_5_1.md`

---

## F. Non-Distortion Clause (Mandatory)
Operators are not allowed to:
- introduce new claims,
- alter the meaning of canon glyphs,
- reinterpret evidence beyond source statements.

Their job is **routing** + **coherence enforcement**.
