# LEGACY LD MAPPING — Adapter Spec (LD0–LD10 → LD/LDF/LDSF/LC) (v2.5.1)

## Purpose
Provides a **label translation** between legacy tiers and current tiers for:
- path fixes
- audit consistency
- avoiding duplicated canon

This mapping is a **routing adapter**. It is not a claim of equivalence.

---

## A. Default Mapping Table
| Legacy Tier | Default Routed Tier | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| LD0 | LC (routing only) | Used only if legacy LD0 described “pre-embodiment / pure potential / return” |
| LD1 | LD1 | Atomics / microstructure / measurement |
| LD2 | LD2 | Integrated physical systems |
| LD3 | LD3 | interaction systems / environment coupling (non-field) |
| LD4 | LD4 | large-scale measurable regimes |
| LD5 | LC (bridge) | If LD5 was used as “boundary/transition layer,” route via continuity adapter |
| LD6 | LDF1 | Legacy-aligned field tier |
| LD7 | LDF2 | Legacy-aligned field tier |
| LD8 | LDF3 | Legacy-aligned field tier |
| LD9 | LDF4 | Legacy-aligned field tier |
| LD10 | LC (continuity) | Continuity statements and collapse/return semantics route here |

---

## B. Exception Policy (Audit-Controlled)
A legacy tier may route differently only if:
1) the legacy document explicitly defines it otherwise, AND  
2) a proof dataset exists supporting the alternative routing, AND  
3) the falsifier is declared

Otherwise the default mapping stands.

---

## C. Naming Convention for Mapped Files
When moving or path-fixing legacy dynamics files:
- keep original name
- append `_legacy`
- store under `.../legacy/`

Example:
`operator_time_inversion.md` → `operator_time_inversion_legacy.md`

---

## D. Non-Distortion Note
Legacy content is preserved as-is.  
Only routing metadata and adapters are added.
