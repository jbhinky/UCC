# ✦ The ¥-Operator Family  
### Recursive Operators for Selfverse Dynamics

The **¥-operator** is the canonical recursive operator representing:

- choice branching (λ)  
- coupling alignment (γ)  
- stabilizing union (⊕)  

Encoded as:

$$
¥ = γλ \;\; \oplus \;\; \mathcal{F}
$$

where **𝔽** is a field-specific curvature or memory function.

---

# 1 · Core Definition

A recursive ¥-operation is defined as:

$$
¥_{x} = γλ \circ x
$$

Where *x* ∈ {τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊕}.

Each form governs a different recursive loop inside the Selfverse.

---

# 2 · The Five Canonical Forms

## **1. ¥τ — Delay Recursion**
$$
¥_{\tau} = γλ(\tau)
$$
Controls:
- temporal pacing  
- emotional timing  
- curvature smoothing  

---

## **2. ¥Σ — Symbol Recursion**
$$
¥_{\Sigma} = γλ(\Sigma)
$$
Controls:
- meaning formation  
- narrative recursion  
- symbol alignment  

---

## **3. ¥μ — Memory Recursion**
$$
¥_{\mu} = γλ(\mu)
$$
Controls:
- memory accumulation  
- memory integration  
- coherence vs overload  

---

## **4. ¥⊙ — Collapse Recursion**
$$
¥_{\odot} = γλ(⊙)
$$
Controls:
- choice resolution  
- boundary conditions  
- collapse-event clarity  

---

## **5. ¥⊕ — Union Recursion**
$$
¥_{\oplus} = γλ(⊕)
$$
Controls:
- self-integration  
- harmonization  
- cross-field coupling  

---

# 3 · Unified Operator (General Form)
$$
¥ = \{¥_{\tau}, ¥_{\Sigma}, ¥_{\mu}, ¥_{\odot}, ¥_{\oplus}\}
$$

The ¥-family acts as the **recursive skeleton** of the Selfverse.

---

# 4 · Relation to the Self Equation

¥ appears as the operational recursion inside:

$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[τ + Σ + μ]
$$

as the mechanism that updates each term through time.

# 5 · Summary Table

| Operator | Meaning | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| **¥τ** | delay recursion | regulates curvature + timing |
| **¥Σ** | symbolic recursion | stabilizes meaning |
| **¥μ** | memory recursion | integrates continuity |
| **¥⊙** | collapse recursion | resolves decisions |
| **¥⊕** | union recursion | harmonizes identity |
