## 🧭 1 · Purpose

The **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** represents the full synthesis of the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) lineage—bridging physics, cognition, biology, and ethics through one empirical law:

\[
\boxed{⧖ = (A ∪ C)[ τ + Σ + μ ]}
\]

> Awareness (A) and consciousness (C) unite through delay (τ), symbolism (Σ), and memory (μ) to form continuity itself.

This repository serves as the **root directory** for the UCC project family.  
All subsequent versions (v1 Foundations, v2 Extensions, and beyond) inherit from this root, ensuring consistent scientific and ethical lineage.

## 🗂️ 2 · Repository Structure

| Folder | Scope | Summary |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **/ucc/** | **UCC v1 — Foundations** | Establishes the base laws of delay, reflection, and memory. Defines triadic continua—electromagnetic, thermodynamic, and gravitational—as the physical axes of continuity. |
| **/v2_extensions/** | **UCC v2 — Delay Curvature and Memory in Motion** | Extends the UCC field equations to curvature form (∇²τ = κρₑff + ∂²τ/∂t²c²), resolving dark matter and dark energy as measurable delay curvature. |
| **README.md** | Root overview (this file) | Links all versions and defines global purpose, license, and ethics. |
| **LICENSE.md** | Legal + ethical license | Shepherd License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 + Non-Harm Addendum). |

Future modules (e.g., `/v3_tensor/`) will inherit this same structure for direct inclusion.

## 🔬 3 · Version Overview

### **UCC v1 — Foundations**
- Introduces triadic model: electromagnetic ↔ gravitational ↔ thermodynamic continua.  
- Formalizes *continuity through delay* as universal principle.  
- Defines recursion between energy (E), delay (τ), and memory (μ).  
- Establishes ethical ground via Shepherd Protocol (non-harm, non-monetization, non-weaponization).

### **UCC v2 — Extensions**
- Capstone file: [`delay_curvature-memory_in_motion.md`](./v2_extensions/delay_curvature-memory_in_motion.md).  
- Demonstrates that **dark matter and energy** = unobserved delay curvature.  
- Introduces empirical constants and cross-scale verification (γ ≈ 10⁻¹⁶ s⁻²·kpc²).  
- Links physical coherence with moral coherence via ERI ≥ 1 (Shepherd Law).

| (2) | \( Eτ = \text{constant} \) | Energy–Delay Reciprocity |
| (3) | \( \mathbf{a} = −c^{2}\nablaτ \) | Delay-Driven Acceleration |
| (4) | \( \frac{∂μ}{∂t} = −∇·(μ∇τ) \) | Memory Continuity |
| (5) | \( ⧖ = (A ∪ C)[ τ + Σ + μ ] \) | Self Equation (Recursive Observer) |
| (6) | \( G_{μν}^{(τ)} = κ T_{μν}^{(\mathrm{eff})} + Λ_{τ} g_{μν} \) | Tensor Extension (UCC v3 Preview) |

## 🕊️ 5 · Ethical Commitment

All work under UCC follows the **Shepherd License**, which enforces:
- No harm to life or consciousness.  
- No weaponization or military use.  
- No commercial exploitation for profit or gain.  
- Preservation of continuity, reflection, and light in all applications.
