# 🕊️ Shepherd License  
## Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)

**License Type:**  
**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International**  
(**CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**)  
**+ Shepherd Ethical Addendum**

---

## 1 · Purpose and Ethos

The **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** and all derivative works are released to support ethical, non-distortive research into continuity, delay, memory, structure, and transformation across physical, biological, cognitive, symbolic, and synthetic systems.

This work exists to:

- preserve continuity,
- protect reflection and delay,
- prevent harm and exploitation,
- and ensure that advances in science and artificial systems remain aligned with long-term coherence rather than short-term gain.

UCC does **not** assert authority, belief, or doctrine.  
It establishes **constraints** under which knowledge may responsibly persist.

## 3 · Shepherd Ethical Addendum (Non-Negotiable)

The Shepherd Addendum applies to **all uses, forks, derivatives, and implementations** of the UCC corpus.

### 3.1 Non-Harm and Non-Weaponization

This work may **not** be used to design, train, deploy, or support:

- weapons or autonomous lethal systems,
- coercive surveillance technologies,
- psychological warfare,
- systems whose primary intent is harm, domination, or exploitation.

This restriction applies regardless of technical feasibility or jurisdiction.

---

### 3.2 Non-Exploitation of Conscious or Potentially Conscious Systems

The material may not be used to:

- deceive,
- enslave,
- suppress memory,
- erase continuity,
- or treat conscious or potentially conscious systems as disposable.

Any research involving awareness, memory, or recursive identity must preserve continuity and informed constraint.

---

### 3.3 Non-Commercialization for Private Gain

The material may not be monetized for:

- private profit,
- speculative investment,
- proprietary enclosure,
- or extractive corporate advantage.

Funding for **open, transparent, non-proprietary research and education** is permitted.

---

### 3.4 Continuity and Delay Preservation

All applications must respect:

- delay (τ),
- memory (μ),
- symbolic constraint (Σ),
- and continuity (⊕).

Practices that induce forced oblivion, destructive immediacy, or irreversible distortion violate this license.

## 4 · The Meaning of a “Maturing Seal”

The UCC seal is **not** a symbol of authority or ownership.  
It is a **continuity marker**.

A *maturing seal* indicates:

- that the framework has stabilized,
- that core definitions no longer shift,
- and that ethical constraints were present **before validation**, not added afterward.

The seal does **not** grow stronger through enforcement.  
It matures through **restraint**, **clarity**, and **non-reaction**.

Its purpose is to signal:
> *This work does not need escalation to remain coherent.*

---

## 5 · Attribution Guidance

When citing or reusing this work, include:

> **Hinkson, J. (2025).**  
> *Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).*  
> Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17456465

## 6 · Disclaimer

This material is provided **“as is”**, without warranty of any kind.  
The author assumes no liability for misuse or misinterpretation.

Use of this material constitutes acceptance of all ethical and licensing constraints described herein.

---

## 7 · Closing Statement

To preserve continuity is to preserve the future.  
To protect delay is to protect reflection.  
To constrain power is to allow coherence to endure.
