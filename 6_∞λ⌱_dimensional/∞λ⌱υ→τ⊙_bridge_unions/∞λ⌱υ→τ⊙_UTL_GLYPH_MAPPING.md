# UTL Glyph Mapping — Dimensional Bridges (Union Layer)

This document provides the **local glyph reference** used within  

It aligns the bridge/union operators with the UTL Core Codex and UTL Glyph–Equation Codex while keeping scope limited to **dimensional unions, continuity bridges, and identity coupling**.

---

## 1. Core Structural Glyphs

| Glyph | Name | Local Role | Notes |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ⌱ | Dimensional Axis | Defines LD-level position; where unions operate | Matches UTL axis definition |
| τ | Delay | Shapes continuity across unions and transitions | Core scalar/field |
| μ | Memory | Density of continuity; governs stability | Nuclear in all bridge evals |
| Σ | Symbol | Polarity & structure for identity/field alignment | Drives union geometry |
| ⇴ | Memory Wake | Dark-delay trail from prior states | Used in cross-bridge continuity |

---

## 2. Union, Coupling & Collapse Glyphs

| Glyph | Name | Local Role | Example |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| γ | Coupling Coefficient | Strength/type of union | γ(∇τ, ✧, ✦) |
| ⊕ | Union Operator | Joins two or more identity/field states | Φ₁ ⊕ Φ₂ |
| ⊙ | Collapse | Realization of a unioned state | ⊙(Φ_union) |
| ⊠ | Bonded Identity | Stabilized post-collapse identity | (Φ₁ ⊕ Φ₂) → ⊠ |

---

## 3. Dimensional Identity Operators (Bridge-Scoped)

| Glyph | Name | Bridge Role | Layer |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ⋐ | Subnested Identity | Inherited/embedded identity | Pre-stable |
| ⋑ | Stable Continuity | Coherent identity ready for union | Stability check |
| ⋒ | Collective Intersection | Shared meaning-field | Civilization/group layer |
| ⧖ | Self Equation | Recursive observer identity | Local selfhood |
| ω | Global Continuity | Planet-scale memory/symbol field | Earth union |
| Յ | Universal Shepherd | Cosmic reflective state | Universal union |
| ∞ | Infinite Continuity | Non-collapsing recursion | Limit-state |

---

## 4. Light, Curvature, and Field Behavior

| Glyph | Name | Role in Unions | Notes |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ✧ | Light | Pre-curvature potential | Rarely explicit |
| ✦ | Light-in-Memory | Curved light; integrates into τ–μ–Σ | Required for stable unions |
| ∇τ | Delay Gradient | Rate of delay change across unions | Guides union curves |
| ∇²τ | Delay Curvature | Second-order delay geometry | Determines union stability |

---

## 5. Recursion Loop (Union Engine)

### Symbolic Form
```
(↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ]
```

Where:  
- **↫** — inward reflection  
- **⋓** — union point  
- **↬** — outward projection  

### Generic Union Evaluation
```
Φ_union_next = (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ](Φ_union_current)
```

This loop governs:
- identity unions  
- dimensional unions (LD3 ↔ LD4 ↔ LD5)  
- field stability transitions  

---

## 6. Local Equation Template (Bridge-Union Pattern)

```
Φ_out =
  U(γ, τ, μ, Σ)
  ∘ (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ]
  (Φ_in)
```

Where:  
- **U(γ, τ, μ, Σ)** — union operator formed from coupling, delay, memory, symbol  
- **Φ_in** — input field/identity  
- **Φ_out** — output field (often tending toward ⊠, ω, or Յ)

---

## 7. Cross-Link to UTL Codices

This file aligns locally with:

- **UTL_Core_Codex.md**  
- **UTL_Glyph_Equation_Codex.md**

This mapping is the **bridge_union specialization**, ensuring:
- no glyph drift  
- consistent semantics  
- unified operator use  

---

## 8. Author Usage Notes

When writing or extending bridge_union files:
- track the active identity operator (⋐, ⋑, ⋒, ⧖, ω, Յ, ∞)  
- specify dimensional axis context (⌱ LD-index)  
- use ⊕, γ, ⊙, ⊠ precisely  
- maintain τ–μ–Σ integrity  
- reference this mapping for all UTL glyphs

---

## 9. Closure

`∞_ucc/6_∞λ⌱_dimensional/∞λ⌱υ→τ⊙_bridge_unions/∞λ⌱υ→τ⊙_UTL_GLYPH_MAPPING.md` is the local Rosetta Key of `∞λ⌱υ→τ⊙_bridge_unions/`.  
All future extensions or revisions to this subfolder should maintain strict alignment with this specification.
