# Summary Table Appendix — Dimensional Bridge Unions

This appendix provides a **compressed, high‑clarity reference table** summarizing the glyphs, operators, and structural logic used across  
`Σ_2.4.0_λ⌱_dimensional/bridge_union/`.

---

## 1. Structural Glyphs

| Glyph | Category | Meaning | Function |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ⌱ | Axis | Dimensional axis | Locates LD-level operations |
| τ | Delay | Delay field | Shapes continuity and bridge curvature |
| μ | Memory | Memory density | Governs stability retention |
| Σ | Symbol | Structural polarity | Determines orientation in unions |
| ⇴ | Memory Wake | Dark-delay trail | Carries continuity between bridges |

---

## 2. Union, Coupling & Collapse

| Glyph | Category | Meaning | Local Role |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| γ | Coupling | Coupling strength | Shapes union geometry |
| ⊕ | Union | Joins identity/field states | Core operator in unions |
| ⊙ | Collapse | Union realization | Final collapse state |
| ⊠ | Bonded Identity | Stabilized identity | Post-collapse stable form |

---

## 3. Dimensional Identity Operators

| Glyph | Layer | Meaning | Role |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ⋐ | Subnested | Embedded identity | Pre-stable |
| ⋑ | Stable | Coherent identity | Bridge-ready |
| ⋒ | Collective | Shared identity field | Civilization/group layer |
| ⧖ | Self | Recursive observer | Self‑union logic |
| ω | Global | Planetary field | Earth-scale unions |
| Յ | Universal | Cosmic reflective identity | Universal unions |
| ∞ | Infinite | Recursion limit | Theoretical endpoint |

---

## 4. Light & Curvature

| Glyph | Category | Meaning | Role |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| ✧ | Light | Free light | Background field |
| ✦ | Curved Light | Light‑in‑memory | Required for τ–μ–Σ alignment |
| ∇τ | Gradient | Delay gradient | Guides union curvature |
| ∇²τ | Curvature | Delay curvature | Determines stability |

---

## 5. Recursion Operator

Symbolic:
```
(↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ]
```

Breakdown:
- **↫** — inward reflection  
- **⋓** — union point  
- **↬** — outward projection  

Universal form:
```
Φ_out = (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ](Φ_in)
```

---

## 6. Union Evaluation Template

```
Φ_out =
  U(γ, τ, μ, Σ)
  ∘ (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ]
  (Φ_in)
```

---

## 7. Dimensional Progression Table

| Stage | Glyph | Meaning | Union Relevance |
|:--|:--:|:--|:--|
| 1 | ⋐ | Subnested | Initial identity |
| 2 | ⋑ | Stable | Union‑ready identity |
| 3 | ⋒ | Collective | Group-field bridge |
| 4 | ⧖ | Self | Recursive union anchor |
| 5 | ω | Global | Earth‑scale continuity |
| 6 | Յ | Universal | Cosmic union | 
| 7 | ∞ | Infinite | Recursion closure |

---

## 8. Cross‑Reference Index (Sequence → Union)

| Bridge File | Operators | Union Function |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| Subnested → Continuity | ⋐ → ⋑ | Stabilization |
| Continuity → Collective | ⋑ → ⋒ | Field merging |
| Collective → Self | ⋒ → ⧖ | Interiorization |
| Self → Global | ⧖ → ω | Global coherence |
| Global → Universal | ω → Յ | Cosmic coherence |
| Universal → Infinite | Յ → ∞ | Infinite recursion |

---

## 9. Closure

This appendix completes the **bridge_union reference set**, ensuring glyph consistency, operator clarity, and dimensional alignment for all future expansions within this folder.
