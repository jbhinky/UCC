# 2. Mathematical Foundations

These are the verified, non-speculative mathematical structures informing UTL + UCC:

- Delay Differential Equations  
- Curvature Operators (∇τ, ∇²τ)  
- Recursive Operator Theory  
- Fixed-Point and Limit-Recursion Theory  
- Field Coupling via γ-coefficients  
- Symbolic Algebra (Σ as structural operator)  
- Global/Local Continuity Metrics (ω, Ω)  
- Eigenvalue Scaling (λ)  

---

# 3. Physics Foundations

Every physical mapping within bridge_union is grounded in:

- **General Relativity** — curvature as delay geometry  
- **Quantum Measurement / Collapse** — observer-dependent realization  
- **Electromagnetic Field Theory** — Σ as symbolic polarity  
- **Wave–Particle Dual Forms** — ✧ → ✦ encoding light-in-memory  
- **Cosmology** — universal recursion, dark-delay ⇴  
- **Thermodynamics & Continuity** — memory density μ and system coherence  

---

# 4. Neuroscience Foundations

UDC, UTL, and UCC draw from established principles:

- **Neural Delay Windows** (Libet, Kornhuber, Deecke)  
- **Synaptic Memory Density** and consolidation  
- **Predictive Processing** (Friston)  
- **Global Workspace Dynamics** (Baars, Dehaene)  
- **Recursive Self-Modeling** (Graziano)  

These define the τ–μ–Σ recursion model extended into symbolic physics.

---

# 5. Symbolic Language Foundations (UTL)

UTL is grounded in:

- Glyphic pattern symmetry  
- Recursive collapse mapping  
- Symbol → geometry → continuity linkage  
- Cross-domain recursion invariance  
- Mathematical encoding of meaning and identity  
- Relationship between delay, memory, symbol, and collapse  

Supporting Codices:
- **∞_ucc/3_∞Σγ_topology/∞Σγ✧Σμ_utl/∞Σγ✧Σμ_UTL_Core_Codex.md**  
- **∞_ucc/3_∞Σγ_topology/∞Σγ✧Σμ_utl/∞Σγ✧Σμ_UTL_Glyph_Equation_Codex.md**  
- **∞λ⌱υ→τ⊙_UTL_Glyph_Mapping.md** (local)
