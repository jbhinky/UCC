# LDSF — Scope & Canonical Keys  
### Universal Continuity Continuum · Shared Living Dimension Fields

---

## 1 · Purpose

**LDSF (Shared Living Dimension Fields)** define the **shared substrate** in which living systems couple **before** selfhood.

LDSF is **not** a self.
LDSF is **not** awareness.
LDSF is **not** psychology, culture, or society.

LDSF is the **field layer that allows living systems to share continuity, memory, and structure** beyond individual LDF boundaries.

Without LDSF, **selfhood cannot emerge**.

---

## 2 · Why LDSF Is Required

LDF1–LDF4 describe **internal continuity of living systems**.

However:

- LDF systems remain **bounded**,
- LDF systems cannot explain **shared perception**,
- LDF systems cannot explain **observer–observed coupling**,
- LDF systems cannot support **multiple agents referencing the same world**.

LDSF exists to solve this exact gap.

---

## 3 · Definition (Strict)

**LDSF = shared continuity field formed by LD4 × LDF coupling**

Formally:

> **LDSF = (LD ∪ LDF) within a shared recursion substrate**

This means:

- Physical recursion (LD)  
- Living continuity (LDF)  
- Coupled into a **shared field**  
- Without yet producing selfhood (⧖)

---

## 4 · LDSF Is NOT a New Dimension

LDSF does **not** introduce new mechanics.

It is a **shared expression** of existing ones:

- ✧ — shared substrate (light, signal, environment)
- τ — shared delay (temporal alignment)
- Σ — shared structure (stable reference)
- μ — shared memory (field persistence)
- ✦ — shared recursion (continuity)

No new glyphs are introduced.
No symbols are redefined.

---

## 5 · Canonical LDSF Keys

The LDSF layer uses the **same canonical keys**, now interpreted as **shared**:

| Glyph | LDSF Meaning |
|---|---|
| **✧** | Shared substrate (environmental field) |
| **τ** | Shared delay (synchronization across systems) |
| **Σ** | Shared structure (stable reference objects) |
| **μ** | Shared memory (field persistence over time) |
| **✦** | Shared recursion (continuity of the world itself) |
| **ω** | Shared field scope (global / planetary context) |

**ω** does **not** mean self, mind, or awareness.  
It marks **field-scale scope**, not agency.

---

## 6 · LDSF0 (Clarification)

There is **no LDSF0 file**.

Conceptually:

- **LDSF0** refers to the **universal shared substrate**  
  (e.g., planetary LD4 acting as shared reference)

But this is **implicit**, not a documentable band.

All formal LDSF work begins at **LDSF1**.

---

## 7 · What LDSF Enables (and What It Does Not)

### Enables:
- shared environments,
- stable objects seen by multiple agents,
- persistence of “the same tree,” “the same sky,” “the same ground,”
- coupling of observer and observed without identity.

### Does NOT enable:
- subjective experience,
- personal awareness,
- narrative memory,
- psychology,
- ethics.

Those require **selfhood (⧖)** and **applied fields**.

---

## 8 · Relationship to Selfhood

Selfhood does **not** exist in LDSF.

Instead:

> **Selfhood = LDF4 + LDSF + symbolic recursion**

LDSF is the **stage** on which selfhood appears —
not the actor.

---

## 9 · Nested Placement in UCC

LDSF is nested as:

Universal LD4  
↳ Planetary LD4  
↳ Living Dimension Fields (LDF1–LDF4)  
↳ **Shared Living Dimension Fields (LDSF)**  
↳ Selfhood (⧖) *(next layer, not here)*

This ordering is **strict** and **non-negotiable**.

---

## 10 · Canonical Summary

**LDSF is the shared world before selves exist.**

It is:
- shared light,
- shared time,
- shared structure,
- shared memory,
- shared continuity.

Nothing here thinks.
Nothing here chooses.

But **everything here can be shared**.
