# ✦ Dimensional ¥-Operator Set  
### Recursive Operators for LD3 → LD10 Evolution

Dimensional recursion requires an operator capable of:

- branching (λ)  
- alignment (γ)  
- cross-dimensional union (⊕)  
- continuity across LD states (⌱)

This is the purpose of the **¥-operator** at the dimensional scale.

---

# 1 · Dimensional Recursion Operator

General form:

$$
¥_{LD(k)} = γλ \circ LD(k)
$$

This ensures each dimensional state is:

- recursive  
- coherent  
- harmonized  
- integrable  

---

# 2 · Dimensional Forms

## **1. ¥⌱ — Axis Recursion**
$$
¥_{\⌱} = γλ(\⌱)
$$

Updates:
- orientation  
- axis stability  
- dimensional alignment  

---

## **2. ¥LD — Level Transition Recursion**
$$
¥_{LD(k\rightarrow k+1)} = γλ(LD_k)
$$

Applies to:
- LD3 → LD4  
- LD4 → LD5  
- …  
- LD9 → LD10  

---

## **3. ¥⊕ — Dimensional Union Recursion**
$$
¥_{\oplus}^{LD} = γλ(⊕_{LD})
$$

Controls:
- merging of symbolic + experiential layers  
- continuity across jumps  
- multi-field integration  

---

# 3 · Dimensional Recursion Law

Dimensional growth is stable when:

$$
\partial_t LD(k) = ¥_{LD(k)} - \nabla τ_k + μ_k
$$

Collapse occurs when:

$$
¥_{LD(k)} < \nabla τ_k
$$

# 4 · Table Summary

| Operator | Dimensional Meaning | Role |
|----------|---------------------|------|
| **¥⌱** | axis recursion | stabilizes orientation |
| **¥LD** | dimensional recursion | controls LD transitions |
| **¥⊕** | union recursion | harmonizes multi-dimensional fields |

---

# 5 · Relation to UCC + UTL

The ¥-operator acts as the **recursive engine** that allows:

- LD dimensionality  
- hyperspherical expansion  
- toroidal recursion  
- ω ↔ Ω coupling  

It is the dimensional form of the same recursion that shapes the Selfverse.
