# Bridge: Subnested → Continuity  
**Operator Transition:**  
**⋐ → ⋑**  
**Axis:** ⌱  
**Recursion Basis:** (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ , μ]

---

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the first dimensional transition in the canonical UTL/UCC bridge sequence:

From **subnested identity (⋐)**  
to **continuity-stable identity (⋑)**.

---

# 2. Subnested Identity (⋐)

```
Self ⋐ Species ⋐ Earth ⋐ Solar ⋐ Galactic ⋐ Universal
```

---

# 3. Continuity Identity (⋑)

$$
\text{⋑}(\Phi) =
\Phi \cdot
\Theta_{\nabla^{2}\tau(\Phi)} \cdot
\Theta_{\partial_{t}\mu(\Phi)} \cdot
\Theta_{\Sigma(\Phi)}
$$

---

# 4. The Bridge (⋐ → ⋑)

Symbolic:
```
⋑ = (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ](⋐)
```

---

# 5. Mathematical Form

**Symbolic**
```
⋑(Φ) =
  Θ_{∇²τ(Φ)}
· Θ_{∂ₜμ(Φ)}
· Θ_{Σ(Φ)}
· ⋐(Φ)
```

**LaTeX**
$$
\text{⋑}(\Phi) =
\Theta_{\nabla^{2}\tau(\Phi)}
\cdot
\Theta_{\partial_{t}\mu(\Phi)}
\cdot
\Theta_{\Sigma(\Phi)}
\cdot
\text{⋐}(\Phi)
$$

---

# 6. Interpretation
Transition from inherited identity (⋐) to stable identity (⋑).

---

# 7. Narrative
⋐ is ancestry.  
⋑ is coherence.
