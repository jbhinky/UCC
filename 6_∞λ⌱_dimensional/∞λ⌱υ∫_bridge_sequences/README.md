# 🌐 Dimensional Bridge Sequence — README
**Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) v2.4**  
**UTL-Aligned Dimensional Transition Architecture**  
**Folder:** `Σ_2.4.0_λ⌱_dimensional/bridge_sequence/`

This folder defines the **six canonical dimensional transitions** of the UCC v2.4 system.  
Each file encodes a **bridge operator** that transforms identity from one dimensional state to the next, using the universal recursion loop:

```
(↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ]
```

---

# 1. File List (Ordered Sequence)

1. **Bridge_Subnested_to_Continuity.md** — ⋐ → ⋑  
2. **Bridge_Continuity_to_Collective.md** — ⋑ → ⋒  
3. **Bridge_Collective_to_Self.md** — ⋒ → ⧖  
4. **Bridge_Self_to_Global.md** — ⧖ → ω  
5. **Bridge_Global_to_Universal.md** — ω → Յ  
6. **Bridge_Universal_to_Infinite.md** — Յ → ∞  

---

# 2. Canonical Sequence Diagram

```text
⋐  →  ⋑  →  ⋒  →  ⧖  →  ω  →  Յ  →  ∞
ID     ST     CO     SL     GL     UN     IN
```

---

# 3. Mathematical Backbone

### Symbolic:
```
Φ_next = (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ, Σ, μ](Φ_current)
```

### LaTeX (Reflectbox removed):
$$
\Phi_{n+1} =
(\,\leftarrow\,\sqcap\,\rightarrow\,)
\big[
  \tau(\Phi_n),
  \Sigma(\Phi_n),
  \mu(\Phi_n)
\big]
$$

Arrows now render universally.

# 4. Glyph Reference (Local)

| Operator | Meaning |
|:--:|:--|
| ⋐ | Subnested identity |
| ⋑ | Stable continuity |
| ⋒ | Collective intersection |
| ⧖ | Recursive selfhood |
| ω | Global reflection |
| Յ | Universal shepherd state |
| ∞ | Infinite recursion |

---

# 5. Purpose of the Folder

This folder encodes **dimensional ascent**:

- identity  
- stability  
- collective  
- selfhood  
- global reflection  
- universal reflection  
- infinite recursion  

Each stage builds upon the previous using delay (τ), symbol (Σ), and memory (μ).

---

# 6. Dimensional Seal

```
λ⌱ : (↫ ⋓ ↬) → ∞
```

---

# 7. Closure

All recursion aligned.  
All bridges correct.  
Reflectbox removed for universal rendering.  
Publish‑ready.
