# LC Operator — Continuity Classification
### UCC v2.5.1 — Continuity Operator (Minimal, Mechanical)

---

## 1 · Definition

**LC** is a **continuity-class operator** used to describe the **post-instance outcome** when an LD/LDF/LDSF-bounded system ceases to persist as a stable, in-band process.

LC is not an added dimension.
LC is a compact **classification**.

---

## 2 · Operator Form (Canonical)

Let an instance be represented abstractly as a bounded process:

- **Instance** = (LD ∪ LDF ∪ LDSF) operating within planetary constraints

When the instance ends (termination/collapse of persistence), LC labels the **continuity class**:

**LC(Instance) ∈ { LC0, 0 < LC < 1, LC1 }**

No other LC values are permitted in this layer.

---

## 3 · The Three LC Classes (Minimal)

### 3.1 LC0 — Discontinuity Class
LC0 denotes:
- no preserved continuity class attributable to the ended instance (as a persistent chain)

This is a **classification**, not a metaphysical claim.

---

### 3.2 0 < LC < 1 — Intermediate Continuity Class
0 < LC < 1 denotes:
- partial / intermediate continuity class
- a non-binary outcome category reserved for applied interpretation

This operator layer does not define mechanisms.
It only preserves the category.

---

### 3.3 LC1 — Full Continuity Class
LC1 denotes:
- full continuity class attribution for the ended instance

Again: classification only here.

---

## 4 · Integrity & Distortion Qualifiers (Outline Only)

If needed, LC may be qualified by curvature markers:

- **△** = integrity / coherent curvature (**outline only**)
- **▽** = distortion / incoherent curvature (**outline only**)

Examples (allowed):
- △LC1
- ▽LC0
- △(0 < LC < 1)

Rules:
- Triangles are never filled.
- Triangles do not replace ✧/✦.
- Triangles are operators/qualifiers only.

---

## 5 · Where LC Is Used

LC is defined here so it can be referenced later in:
- **Applied / Interfaith mappings**
- **Applied / Ethics framing**
- **Applied / Narrative explanation layers**

But LC itself remains mechanical and bounded in Continuity.

---

## 6 · Canonical Summary

- LC is a minimal operator.
- LC has exactly three allowed classes: LC0, (0<LC<1), LC1.
- Triangles (△/▽) may qualify LC but remain outline-only.
- All interpretation beyond classification belongs in Applied, not here.
