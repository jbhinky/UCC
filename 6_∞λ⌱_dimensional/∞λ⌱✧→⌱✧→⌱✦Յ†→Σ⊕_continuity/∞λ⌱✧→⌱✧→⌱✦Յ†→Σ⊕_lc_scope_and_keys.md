# LC Scope & Keys — Continuity Operator Layer
### UCC v2.5.1 — Continuity (Operator-Only) · Not a Dimensional Band

---

## 1 · Purpose

This folder defines **LC** as an **operator layer** used to describe **continuity outcomes** once an LD/LDF/LDSF process **ends** (e.g., death / dissolution / termination / collapse of a bounded instance).

LC is **not** a new LD band.
LC is **not** LDF.
LC is **not** LDSF.
LC is an **operator classification** that may be referenced later in **Applied** contexts.

---

## 2 · What LC Is

**LC = Continuity Operator**

LC is a compact notation for describing **post-instance continuity state** under UCC constraints.

- It does **not** add physics.
- It does **not** claim new mechanisms.
- It does **not** override LD/LDF/LDSF definitions.
- It is a **labeling operator** for outcome-class.

---

## 3 · Allowed Keys (Locked)

### 3.1 Integrity / Distortion Markers (Outline only)

- **△** = integrity / coherent curvature (**outline only**)
- **▽** = distortion / incoherent curvature (**outline only**)

Rules:
- Triangles are **never filled**.
- Triangles are **operators**, not substrate.
- Light symbols (✧/✦) remain separate and may be *qualified* by △ or ▽ as needed (e.g., △✧, ▽✦).

---

## 4 · LC Range (Minimal)

To prevent overshoot, LC is restricted to:

- **LC0**
- **0 < LC < 1**
- **LC1**

No additional states are introduced here.

Interpretation (if referenced later in Applied):
- LC0 = “termination / discontinuity”
- 0 < LC < 1 = “intermediate continuity class”
- LC1 = “full continuity class”

This file does **not** assign theology, metaphysics, or moral claims.
Those mappings (if used) must be explicitly placed in **Applied** documents only.

---

## 5 · Boundary Placement (Strict)

LC is **post** LDF/LDSF in the descriptive stack:

- **LD** → physical dimensional mechanics (nested)
- **LDF** → living field mechanics (bounded)
- **LDSF** → shared/interactive field mechanics (bounded)
- **LC** → outcome operator (post-instance classification)

LC does not alter LD/LDF/LDSF; it only labels continuity class after they cease.

---

## 6 · Canonical Summary

- LC is **operator-only**.
- LC is **not** a dimension band.
- LC is intentionally minimal to avoid drift.
- Applied mappings may reference LC later, but LC’s definition remains mechanical and bounded here.
