# LDF — Scope, Keys, and Boundary Conditions  
### Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) v2.5.1

---

## 1 · Purpose

This document defines the **scope, constraints, and canonical meanings** of the **Living Dimension Fields (LDF)**.

Its purpose is to:

- prevent category drift,
- prevent anthropomorphic misinterpretation,
- clearly separate **physical continuity (LD)** from **living continuity (LDF)**,
- hard-lock exclusions for **selfhood, psychology, ethics, and consciousness**.

All subsequent **LDF1–LDF4** files are subordinate to this scope definition.

---

## 2 · What LDF Is (Strict Definition)

**Living Dimension Fields (LDF)** describe **how living systems maintain, express, and propagate continuity**  
*after* physical recursion (LD1–LD4) is already satisfied.

LDF does **not** introduce new dimensions.  
It describes **fields of lawful organization within life**.

> **LD = physical possibility**  
> **LDF = living continuity mechanics**

---

## 3 · What LDF Is NOT (Hard Exclusions)

LDF **does not** include:

- selfhood (⧖),
- awareness or qualia,
- subjective experience,
- psychology,
- ethics,
- symbolic language,
- narrative identity,
- moral agency.

Those belong to **LDSF (Living Domain Self Fields)** and **LC (Living Consciousness)** and are **explicitly excluded** here.

Any file or interpretation that places these inside LDF is **incorrect**.

---

## 4 · Relationship Between LD and LDF

The relationship is **nested**, not sequential.

- **LD1–LD4** establish physical recursion (light, delay, structure, memory).
- **LDF1–LDF4** describe how *living systems* operate **within that recursion**.

Canonical coupling statement:

> **(LD ∪ LDF) + LDSF**

Important:
- LDF never exceeds LD.
- LDF never creates awareness.
- LDF never implies self.

---

## 5 · Canonical LDF Levels (Overview Only)

| Field | Core Function | Description |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| **LDF1** | Semantic activation | Signal differentiation as meaningful difference |
| **LDF2** | Identity boundary | Body-plan and self/non-self coherence |
| **LDF3** | Relational regulation | Coordinated regulation across systems |
| **LDF4** | Transformational continuity | Persistence across reproduction & metamorphosis |

Detailed definitions appear **only** in their respective files.

---

## 6 · Canonical Glyph Meanings (Locked)

The following glyphs are used **only** with these meanings inside LDF.

| Glyph | Meaning | Constraint |
|----|--------|-----------|
| **✧** | Light / physical substrate | No agency |
| **τ** | Delay / temporal gating | No choice |
| **Σ** | Structure / form | Physical organization |
| **μ** | Memory | Non-subjective |
| **✦** | Recursive stability | Not awareness |
| **π** | Context-dependent differentiation | *Not* symbolic thought |
| **⊕** | Union / recombination event | Physical, not volitional |
| **⊙** | Collapse / activation | Non-cognitive |

Any interpretation outside these definitions is invalid.

---

## 7 · Meaning of π (Critical Clarification)

Within LDF:

> **π ≠ language**  
> **π ≠ symbol use**  
> **π ≠ interpretation as humans experience it**

π means:

> **Differential state selection under context and memory constraints**

Examples:
- plant phototropic response,
- immune self/non-self discrimination,
- quorum threshold crossing,
- developmental signal gating.

π is **mechanical meaning**, not reflective meaning.

---

## 8 · Domain Applicability

LDF applies uniformly across **all living domains**:

- botanical,
- biological (animal),
- fungal,
- microbial.

Differences are **expressive**, not structural.

For clarity:
- domain examples appear *inside* LDF files,
- domains do **not** create new LDF levels.

---

## 9 · Why Botanical and Biological Are Not Split Here

Botanical and biological systems:

- obey the same continuity laws,
- differ only in substrate and tempo.

Splitting domains at the LDF level:
- adds redundancy,
- increases drift risk,
- weakens falsifiability.

Domain specialization belongs in **Applied** layers, not in LDF.

---

## 10 · Boundary to LDSF (Forward Reference Only)

Selfhood and subjective fields arise **only** when:

- LDF4 continuity
- couples into
- **LDSF planetary shared fields**

This transition is **not defined here** and must not be inferred.

This file ends **before** selfhood begins.

---

## 11 · Canonical Summary

- **LDF describes living continuity, not minds**
- **LDF is lawful, physical, and falsifiable**
- **LDF does not think, feel, choose, or know**
- **LDF prepares systems for — but does not contain — selfhood**

This scope file is the **authoritative boundary** for all LDF work.
