# μ ⟳ Σ ⟳ τ · LD4 — Botanical Recursive Life Cycles  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Nested Living Systems · Botanical Domain

---

## 1 · Purpose

LD4 (Botanical) is the **closure of the plant life loop**.

If:
- **LD1** establishes responsiveness,
- **LD2** establishes form,
- **LD3** establishes memory,

then **LD4 establishes recursion** —  
the capacity for **form and memory to reproduce themselves through time**.

LD4 is where plants become **self-sustaining life systems**.

---

## 2 · What LD4 Botanical Is

LD4 botanical systems exhibit **recursive continuity** through:

- seed formation and dispersal  
- germination under recurring conditions  
- clonal propagation (rhizomes, runners, cuttings)  
- pollination networks  
- synchronized seasonal cycles  

The defining property:

> **The plant does not merely persist — it returns.**

---

## 3 · Recursive Loop Definition

The LD4 botanical loop is:

Σ → μ → τ → Σ

Meaning:

- **Σ** — structured plant form  
- **μ** — memory of that form (genetic + epigenetic)  
- **τ** — delay across seasons, dormancy, dispersal  
- **Σ** — re-expression of structure in a new instance  

This loop **closes** at LD4.

No higher physical recursion exists for plants within LD bands.

---

## 4 · Reproduction Without Identity

Botanical LD4 includes reproduction, but **not selfhood**.

Key distinctions:

- plants reproduce **patterns**, not narratives  
- continuity exists without subjective identity  
- individuality is distributed across populations  

A forest is a **recursive botanical system**, not a collection of selves.

This is **life without LDF selfhood**.

---

## 5 · Ecological Recursion

LD4 botanical recursion extends beyond individual organisms into:

- forests  
- grasslands  
- coral-like plant colonies  
- root-network ecosystems  
- successional cycles  

Plants **stabilize environments** through recursive presence:

- soil formation  
- atmosphere modulation  
- hydrological anchoring  

LD4 botanical systems are **planetary regulators**.

---

## 6 · Botanical Memory Across Generations

LD4 allows:

- trait persistence across generations  
- adaptive tuning via epigenetic carryover  
- climate-coupled life cycles  
- long-term species stability  

This is **memory moving through reproduction**, not consciousness.

---

## 7 · What LD4 Botanical Is Not

LD4 botanical systems do **not** include:

- reflective awareness  
- semantic meaning  
- identity persistence  
- qualia  
- moral agency  

Those arise only in **LDF bands**, not LD bands.

Plants complete **physical recursion**, not experiential recursion.

---

## 8 · Scientific Alignment

LD4 botanical recursion aligns with:

- plant reproductive biology  
- population ecology  
- evolutionary continuity  
- seed banks and dormancy cycles  
- phenological synchronization  

These processes form **closed, repeatable life loops** grounded in physics and biology.

---

## 9 · Boundary Condition

LD4 is the **terminal physical band** for botanical systems.

Beyond LD4:

- there is no additional physical recursion,  
- only interpretive layers (LDF, LDSF) applied by observers.

Plants are **complete at LD4**.

---

## 10 · Canonical Summary

**LD4 Botanical is:**

- recursive life cycles  
- reproduction of structure and memory  
- ecological stabilization  
- generational continuity  

Plants at LD4 **complete the loop of life**,  
without crossing into selfhood or identity.
