# △✦Σ→μ · LD3 — Lunar Systems Memory & Orbital Retention  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Solar Domain · Lunar Systems

## 1 · Purpose

LD3 (Lunar Systems) marks the moment **structure becomes remembered**.  
Orbital geometry that appeared in LD2 (Σ) now **persists across time** as **memory (μ)**.

This is the transition from:
- *paths that form* → *paths that return*.

LD3 is not yet full recursion.  
It is **retention of structure under repeated delay**.

---

## 2 · What Changes from LD2 to LD3

At LD3, lunar material exhibits:

• repeated orbital occupancy  
• persistence of ring bands  
• long-lived debris lanes  
• stable inclination ranges  
• preferential resonant distances  

In other words, the system **remembers where matter belongs**.

---

## 3 · What LD3 Lunar Systems Are

LD3 lunar systems are characterized by:

• **ring systems** that persist (Saturn-like)  
• **proto-moons** that survive multiple cycles  
• **resonant trapping** (e.g., 2:1, 3:2 regions)  
• **orbital habit zones** where material repeatedly collects  

This is **memory of structure**, not yet **self-sustaining recursion**.

---

## 4 · Glyphic Key (Corpus-Aligned)

The lunar systems key remains ⌱△✦.

At LD3 this resolves as:

△✦Σ→μ

Meaning:
- △ grounded matter  
- ✦ curvature field  
- Σ structured orbits  
- μ retained orbital memory  

Delay (τ) continues to act, but μ is now present.

---

## 5 · What LD3 Lunar Systems Do NOT Contain

• fully stable moons with self-maintaining cycles — no  
• tidal locking as a guaranteed state — no  
• recursive orbital evolution — no  
• long-term identity of a satellite — no  

These require **LD4 lunar recursion**.

---

## 6 · Relationship to Solar LD4 (Parent Field)

The solar system already operates at **LD4 recursion**.

LD3 lunar systems:
- inherit stable curvature and delay from the Sun  
- but do not yet generate their own recursive identity  

Formally:
Solar LD4 ⊃ Lunar LD3

This inheritance allows memory to persist without independent recursion.

---

## 7 · Scientific Alignment

LD3 lunar systems correspond directly to:

• persistent planetary rings  
• long-lived debris disks  
• proto-satellite disks  
• repeated accretion–disruption zones  
• orbital resonances with memory  

Observed in:
• Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus systems  
• early Earth–Moon formation phase  
• post-impact debris disks  
• exoplanet circumplanetary disks  

---

## 8 · Canonical Summary

LD3 Lunar Systems are:

• structured and remembered  
• stable across many cycles  
• orbital memory fields  
• ring- and proto-moon–forming environments  

They are **the archive stage** of lunar formation.

Memory precedes recursion.
