# △✦τ→Σ · LD2 — Lunar Systems Structural Emergence  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Solar Domain · Lunar Systems

## 1 · Purpose

LD2 (Lunar Systems) marks the **first appearance of structure (Σ)** in grounded matter (△) under curvature (✦) experiencing delay (τ).  
Where LD1 was asymmetry without form, **LD2 is form without memory**.

This band defines when proto-lunar matter begins to assume **recognizable orbital geometry**—still unstable, still revisable, but no longer random.

---

## 2 · What Changes from LD1 to LD2

At LD2, lunar material transitions from scattered delay to **organized paths**:

• proto-orbits begin to appear  
• preferred planes form  
• resonant paths start to dominate  
• ring-like bands coalesce  
• capture zones sharpen  

These are **structural patterns**, not retained histories.

---

## 3 · What LD2 Lunar Systems Are

LD2 lunar systems are characterized by:

• repeated spatial paths  
• emerging orbital planes  
• geometric ordering of debris  
• gravitational sorting by distance and mass  

Matter is now **organized**, but not yet **remembered**.

In corpus terms:  
delay (τ) acting repeatedly on grounded matter (△) under curvature (✦) produces **structure (Σ)**.

---

## 4 · Glyphic Key (Corpus-Aligned)

The lunar systems key remains ⌱△✦.

At LD2 this resolves as:

△✦τ→Σ

Meaning:
- △ grounded matter  
- ✦ curvature field  
- τ repeated delay  
- Σ emergent structure  

No μ appears yet.  
No recursion yet.

---

## 5 · What LD2 Lunar Systems Do NOT Contain

• stable moons — no  
• long-term orbital retention — no  
• tidal locking — no  
• compositional memory — no  
• recursive orbital cycles — no  

All of these require LD3 or LD4.

---

## 6 · Relationship to Solar LD4

The solar system already holds LD4 recursion.  
LD2 lunar systems **inherit the environment**, not the recursion.

Solar LD4 provides:
• stable curvature background  
• long-term delay consistency  

But the lunar system itself is only **structurally ordered**, not recursively stabilized.

---

## 7 · Scientific Alignment

LD2 lunar systems correspond directly to:

• proto-ring formation  
• Roche limit banding  
• resonant debris belts  
• early satellite plane emergence  
• structured capture disks  

These are observed in:
• Saturnian rings  
• Jovian debris systems  
• circumplanetary disks  
• post-impact planetary systems  

All precede true moons.

---

## 8 · Canonical Summary

LD2 Lunar Systems are:

• structured but unstable  
• geometric without memory  
• ordered without recursion  
• proto-orbital fields  

They represent **the blueprint stage** from which stable moons and rings can later emerge.
