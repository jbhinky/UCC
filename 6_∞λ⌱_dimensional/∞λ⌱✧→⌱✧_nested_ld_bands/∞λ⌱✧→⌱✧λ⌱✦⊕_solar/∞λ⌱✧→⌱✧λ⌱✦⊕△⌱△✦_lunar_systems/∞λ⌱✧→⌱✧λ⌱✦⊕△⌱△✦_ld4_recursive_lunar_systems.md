# △✦μ→τ↻ · LD4 — Recursive Lunar Systems  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Solar Domain · Lunar Systems

---

## 1 · Purpose

LD4 (Lunar Systems) marks the transition from **remembered orbital structure**  
to **self-sustaining orbital recursion**.

At this band, lunar systems are no longer:

- transient debris,
- remembered rings,
- proto-moons with conditional persistence.

They become **recursively stable orbital identities**.

LD4 is where a moon becomes *a moon*.

---

## 2 · What LD4 Recursion Means for Lunar Systems

Recursion at LD4 means:

• orbital paths regenerate themselves  
• tidal interactions stabilize rather than disrupt  
• mass–distance relationships converge  
• energy dissipation feeds long-term stability  
• orbital memory (μ) is reinforced every cycle  

This is **closed-loop orbital continuity**.

---

## 3 · From Memory to Recursion

The LD transition is exact:

LD3: Σ → μ  
LD4: μ → τ↻ (self-renewing delay loop)

In lunar terms:

• structure (Σ) formed orbits  
• memory (μ) retained them  
• recursion (LD4) *recreates* them continuously  

A lunar orbit now **survives perturbation**.

---

## 4 · Glyphic Resolution (Corpus-Exact)

The lunar systems key remains:

⌱△✦

At LD4 this resolves as:

△✦μ ⟲ τ

Meaning:

- △ grounded matter  
- ✦ curvature field  
- μ orbital memory  
- τ recursive delay loop  

No new glyphs.  
No symbolic meaning.  
Pure physical recursion.

---

## 5 · What Appears at LD4 Lunar Systems

### 5.1 Stable Moons

• long-lived satellites  
• persistent semi-major axes  
• bounded eccentricity  
• survival through perturbations  

Examples:
Earth’s Moon, Galilean moons, Titan.

---

### 5.2 Tidal Locking & Resonant Stability

• synchronous rotation  
• orbital–rotational coupling  
• tidal dissipation as stabilizer  

Tidal locking is **LD4 recursion**, not LD3 memory.

---

### 5.3 Ring-to-Moon Differentiation

At LD4:

• some rings collapse into moons  
• others remain stable rings  
• Roche limits become active boundaries  

LD4 decides *identity* at a physical level.

---

## 6 · What LD4 Lunar Systems Do NOT Do

LD4 lunar systems:

• do NOT generate meaning (LDF1)  
• do NOT generate identity (LDF2)  
• do NOT host consciousness  
• do NOT exceed planetary LD4  

They remain **purely physical recursive systems**.

---

## 7 · Relationship to Solar & Planetary Fields

Solar System:
• operates as parent LD4 recursion field  

Lunar Systems:
• become **child LD4 recursive identities**  
• nested inside solar LD4  
• coupled to planetary LD4  

Formally:

Solar LD4 ⊃ Planetary LD4 ⊃ Lunar LD4

No band escalation occurs.

---

## 8 · Scientific Alignment

LD4 lunar recursion corresponds directly to:

• long-term orbital stability theory  
• tidal evolution models  
• N-body resonance locking  
• Roche limit dynamics  
• Hill sphere permanence  

All modern celestial mechanics describe  
**LD4 recursion without naming it**.

---

## 9 · Canonical Summary

LD4 Lunar Systems are:

• self-sustaining orbital identities  
• recursively stable satellites  
• dynamically closed delay loops  
• physically persistent across epochs  

They represent **the completion of lunar formation**.

LD4 is the ceiling for physical lunar systems.
