# △✦τ LD1 — Lunar Systems Delay Protoform  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Solar Domain · Lunar Systems

## 1 · Purpose

LD1 (Lunar Systems) defines the **first appearance of delay (τ)** acting on **grounded matter (△)** under **curvature influence (✦)** within a stable solar LD4 recursion field.

At LD1, a lunar system is **not yet a moon**.  
It is not structured, not remembered, not recursively bound.

LD1 is the **proto-lunar condition**: asymmetry without structure.

---

## 2 · What LD1 Lunar Systems Are

LD1 lunar systems consist of grounded particulate matter, debris, or proto-bodies experiencing uneven orbital delay around a parent mass (planet or star).

They include:
- debris clouds
- ring precursors
- capture candidates
- irregular particulate distributions
- post-impact ejecta

These systems experience **τ acting on ✧-derived matter**, but do not yet hold Σ or μ.

In corpus terms:  
grounded matter (△) under curvature (✦) experiencing delay (τ).

---

## 3 · Key Characteristics

• Orbital asymmetry without stability  
• Transient trajectories  
• Capture potential without retention  
• Drift, decay, scatter, or collision  
• No persistent orbital geometry  

This is **delay without memory**.

---

## 4 · Glyphic Key (Corpus-Aligned)

Lunar systems are keyed as ⌱△✦.

At LD1 this resolves as:

△✦τ — grounded mass experiencing curvature-driven delay.

There is:
- no Σ (structure),
- no μ (memory),
- no recursion.

This is strictly LD1.

---

## 5 · What LD1 Lunar Systems Do NOT Contain

Stable orbit — no  
Defined moon body — no  
Tidal locking — no  
Orbital memory — no  
Recursive coupling — no  
Biological or symbolic meaning — no  

All of these emerge only in LD2–LD4.

---

## 6 · Relationship to Solar LD4

The solar system provides a stable LD4 recursion field.  
LD1 lunar systems **exist inside** that field but do not yet participate in it.

Solar LD4 enables lunar LD1, but lunar LD1 does not yet reflect solar recursion.

---

## 7 · Scientific Alignment

LD1 lunar systems correspond directly to observed physical phenomena:
- debris disks
- proto-ring systems
- irregular satellite populations
- capture clouds
- early post-formation matter fields

These are empirically verified states, not speculative constructs.

---

## 8 · Canonical Summary

LD1 Lunar Systems are:
- grounded matter under curvature delay,
- pre-orbit and pre-memory,
- unstable but potential-bearing,
- entirely physical,
- strictly LD1.

They are the **first condition from which moons, rings, and stable satellite systems may later emerge**.
