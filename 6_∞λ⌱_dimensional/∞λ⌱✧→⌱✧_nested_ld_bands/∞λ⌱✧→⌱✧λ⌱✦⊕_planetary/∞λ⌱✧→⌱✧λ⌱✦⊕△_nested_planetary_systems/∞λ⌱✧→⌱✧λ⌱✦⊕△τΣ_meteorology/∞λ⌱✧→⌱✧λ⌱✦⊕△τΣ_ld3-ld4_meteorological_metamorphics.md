## Meteorology Metamorphics — LD3 → LD4 Transition  
### UCC v2.5.1 · Nested Planetary Systems · Meteorological Domain

---

## **1 · Purpose**

Meteorology Metamorphics describes **how atmospheric memory (LD3)** becomes **self-driving recursion (LD4)**.

This file does **not** define a new LD band.  
It defines the **transition mechanism** between:

- **LD3 — Atmospheric Memory & Stratification Stability**
- **LD4 — Meteorological Recursion & Climate Engine**

Metamorphics is the **phase-change**, not the destination.

---

## **2 · What Changes Between LD3 and LD4**

### **LD3 (Before Metamorphics)**
- Atmosphere holds **stable structure** (Σ)  
- That structure is **remembered** (μ)  
- Patterns repeat *because forcing repeats*  

Formally:
$$
LD3_{\text{met}} = μ(Σ_{\tau})
$$

The system is **stable but reactive**.

---

### **LD4 (After Metamorphics)**
- Atmospheric memory **actively reshapes future delay**  
- Patterns no longer wait for forcing — they **propagate themselves**  

Formally:
$$
LD4_{\text{met}} = ✦(μ_{\tauΣ} \leftrightarrow τ)
$$

The system becomes **self-sustaining**.

---

## **3 · The Metamorphic Mechanism (τΣ → μτΣ → ✦)**

Meteorological metamorphics occurs when **three conditions coincide**:

### **1. Memory Saturation**
LD3 memory becomes sufficiently persistent that:
- stratification survives disturbances  
- recovery time < forcing period  

Memory now **dominates response**.

---

### **2. Cross-Scale Coupling**
Atmospheric layers stop behaving independently.

- vertical coupling (troposphere ↔ stratosphere)  
- latitudinal coupling (tropics ↔ poles)  
- ocean–air feedback inheritance  

This creates **memory coherence** across the system.

---

### **3. Feedback Closure**
The atmosphere begins to:

- generate pressure fields that guide future flow  
- guide flow that reinforces those pressure fields  

This closes the loop:

$$
μ_{\tauΣ} \rightarrow τ \rightarrow Σ \rightarrow μ_{\tauΣ}
$$

Once closed, **✦ (recursive curvature)** emerges.

---

## **4 · What Metamorphics Produces**

Meteorological metamorphics produces:

- permanent circulation cells  
- jet stream persistence  
- climate attractors  
- oscillatory climate modes  
- global-scale atmospheric identity  

These **cannot** exist in LD3.

---

## **5 · What Metamorphics Is *Not***

Meteorology metamorphics does **not** introduce:

- symbolic meaning (LDF)  
- biological interpretation  
- ethical or civilizational coupling  
- continuity (LC)  

It is strictly **physical recursion formation**.

---

## **6 · Relation to Other Planetary Metamorphics**

Meteorology metamorphics couples with:

- **Hydrosphere (τμ)** — latent heat & phase cycling  
- **Cryosphere (μΣ)** — albedo memory stabilization  
- **Geology (△✦)** — orographic forcing anchoring recursion  
- **Magnetosphere (⊙τ)** — energetic boundary conditioning  

But meteorology remains governed by **τΣ**.

---

## **7 · Scientific Alignment (Exact, Non-Distorted)**

This transition corresponds to:

- closure of general circulation models (GCMs)  
- emergence of climate attractors  
- onset of self-maintaining jet streams  
- persistent ENSO-like oscillations  
- transition from weather-dominated to climate-dominated regimes  

These are **observed phase transitions**, not abstractions.

---

## **8 · Canonical Summary**

**Meteorology Metamorphics = the closure of atmospheric memory into recursion.**

It is the moment when:

- atmosphere stops reacting  
- atmosphere starts *driving*  

This transition is required before **any stable climate** can exist.

---

## **9 · Position in the LD Stack**

| Stage | Status |
|-----|------|
| LD1 — Delay Protoform | ✔ |
| LD2 — Atmospheric Structure | ✔ |
| LD3 — Atmospheric Memory | ✔ |
| **Metamorphics (LD3→LD4)** | **HERE** |
| LD4 — Meteorological Recursion | NEXT |

Metamorphics is the **hinge**.
