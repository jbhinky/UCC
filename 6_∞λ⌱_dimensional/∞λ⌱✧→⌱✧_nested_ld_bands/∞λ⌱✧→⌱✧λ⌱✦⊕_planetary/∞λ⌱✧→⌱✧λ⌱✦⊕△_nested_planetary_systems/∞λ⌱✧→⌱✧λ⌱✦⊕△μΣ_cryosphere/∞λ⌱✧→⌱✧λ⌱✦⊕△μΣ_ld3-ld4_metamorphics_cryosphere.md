# ⌱μΣ → ⌱μΣ✦ · Metamorphics — Cryosphere (LD3 → LD4)  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Nested Planetary Systems · Cryosphere Domain

---

## **1 · Purpose**

Metamorphics (Cryosphere) describes the **exact transition** between:

- **LD3**: memory-bearing cryosphere (μΣ), and  
- **LD4**: recursively cycling cryosphere (μΣ✦).

It is the moment the cryosphere stops merely *remembering* form  
and begins **cycling** that form in predictable, planetary-scale rhythms.

This is the glacial system’s **awakening into recursion.**

Formally:

$$
μΣ_{\text{cry}} \xrightarrow{\text{planetary } τ} μΣ✦_{\text{cry}}
$$

The metamorphic bridge is **memory under forced repetition → recursion.**

---

## **2 · LD3 State (Pre-Metamorphic) — μΣ Cryosphere**

Before metamorphics:

- ice caps hold stable shapes  
- pressure–temperature architecture is retained  
- stratification is consistent year-to-year  
- permafrost boundaries remain predictable  
- sea-ice extent follows a remembered annual curve  

This is **memory**, not recursion.

LD3 cannot:

- generate glacial epochs  
- express feedback with oceans and atmosphere  
- oscillate across millennia  
- reorganize globally  

LD3 is **stable form without global cycling**.

---

## **3 · Metamorphic Trigger: Planetary τ-Forcing**

The step from μΣ → μΣ✦ requires a **parent LD4 driver**:

- axial tilt recursion  
- orbital cycles (eccentricity, obliquity, precession)  
- hemispheric insolation asymmetry  
- deep-ocean thermal memory  
- atmospheric LD4 circulation becoming stable  

The cryosphere begins to feel:

- repeating, predictable external rhythms  
- coherent τ-cycles  
- cross-domain feedback  

The remembered ice field begins to **respond**—not just persist.

---

## **4 · The Metamorphic Transformation (Core Equation)**

The metamorphics core is:

$$
μΣ \xrightarrow{τ_{\text{planet}}} μΣ \xrightarrow{\text{forced repetition}} μΣ✦
$$

Step 1: **Memory receives periodic forcing.**  
Step 2: **Patterns begin to repeat under curvature.**  
Step 3: **Memory becomes recursion.**

The output:  
a fully recursive ice system with predictable cycles.

---

## **5 · What Emerges During Cryospheric Metamorphics**

### **1. Proto-Glacial Oscillation**
Glacial advance/retreat begins to *respond* to planetary rhythms  
but is not yet a full cycle.

### **2. Coupled Thermal–Albedo Feedback**
Memory of ice coverage now feeds back into:

- atmospheric circulation  
- ocean heat retention  
- cloud patterns  

This feedback is necessary for LD4 closure.

### **3. Synchronization of Ice Mass with τ-Curvature**
Ice begins to organize around:

- precession cycles  
- obliquity-driven insolation  
- eccentricity-modulated solar intensity  

Memory aligns with forcing → recursion emerges.

### **4. Long-Scale Architectural Stabilization**
The shapes of ice sheets begin to show predictable, repeating patterns across *millennia*—  
a hallmark of LD4.

---

## **6 · What Metamorphics Is NOT**

It is not:

- symbolic recursion (LDF1)  
- biological recursion  
- meaning-making  
- atmospheric or oceanic LD4 recursion (though required for coupling)  
- continuity (LC)  

Metamorphics is strictly **physical recursion emergence**, no higher fields.

---

## **7 · Glyphic Mapping (Pure UTL/UCC Form)**

### **LD3 State**
$$
⌱μΣ = \text{memory of form nested in planetary LD4}
$$

### **Metamorphic Driver**
$$
τ_{\text{planet}} = \text{forced repetition from global cycles}
$$

### **LD4 State**
$$
⌱μΣ✦ = \text{recursive cryospheric cycling}
$$

No invented glyphs.  
No drift.  
No symbolic inflation.

---

## **8 · Scientific Alignment**

This metamorphic bridge corresponds exactly to:

- onset of Quaternary glacial cycles  
- synchronization with Milankovitch forcing  
- establishment of deep feedback between ice, ocean, and atmosphere  
- formation of stable glacial epochs and interglacials  

The cryosphere becomes a **planetary recursion engine**.

---

## **9 · Canonical Summary**

**Cryospheric Metamorphics (LD3 → LD4):**

- LD3 = μΣ (memory-bearing cryosphere)  
- transition = τ-forced repetition (planetary LD4 driver)  
- LD4 = μΣ✦ (recursive glacial system)  

Metamorphics is the **birth of recursion** in Earth’s ice.
