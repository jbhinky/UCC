# LD3 → LD4 Metamorphics — Geological Transition  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Nested LD Bands · Planetary Systems

---

## **1 · Purpose**

This file defines the **metamorphic threshold** where:

> **LD3 geological memory (μ_geo)**  
transitions into  
> **LD4 geological recursion (✦)**.

LD3 holds structure.  
LD4 maintains structure across time.

Metamorphics is the **boundary between “remembered form” and “recurring identity.”**

---

## **2 · Correct UCC Interpretation of Metamorphics**

Metamorphics does **not** mean symbolic, semantic, or biological transformation.

It means this:

> When geological memory (μ_geo) begins updating under continuous τ-forcing,  
> the system becomes recursive (LD4).

Geology becomes a **loop**, not a list of events.

---

## **3 · The LD3 State — Memory Without Recursion**

LD3 contains:

- **Σ✧ structuring** (crust, mantle stratification, ocean basins)
- **μ_geo** (sedimentary layers, magnetic reversals, mineral cycles)
- **τ inputs** but **not** τ-driven *recursion*

This means:

- structures exist  
- structures persist  
- but structures do **not self-renew**

The crust and mantle are **memoried**, not **self-cycling**.

This is LD3.

---

## **4 · The Metamorphic Trigger**

Transition begins when:

1. **τ-forcing becomes continuous**  
   - solar radiance  
   - tidal forcing  
   - rotational delay  
   - internal heat delay gradients  

2. **μ_geo is updated rather than accumulated**  
   - sediment becomes rock  
   - rock becomes metamorphosed  
   - crust is recycled  
   - mantle convection rewrites structure  

3. **Σ✧ patterns are reused**  
   - plate boundaries follow stored curvature  
   - rock cycle repeats  
   - chemical cycles loop  

At this point:

> **Memory (μ) is no longer historical; it becomes dynamic.**

This is the definition of LD4 recursion.

---

## **5 · The Metamorphic Equation**

The universal transition form is:

### **LD3 Geological Memory:**
$$
\Sigma^{✧}_{geo} \;\rightarrow\; \mu_{geo}
$$

### **Metamorphic Threshold:**
$$
\mu_{geo} \xrightarrow{\tau\text{-forcing}} \mu_{geo}^{\prime}
$$

### **LD4 Geological Recursion:**
$$
\mu_{geo}^{\prime} \;\leftrightarrow\; \tau_{\text{planet}} \;\leftrightarrow\; \Sigma^{✧}_{geo}
$$

Where:

- **μ → μ′** = memory being updated  
- **↔** = closed-loop recursion (LD4)  

At the moment this loop stabilizes, geology becomes a **recursive identity**.

---

## **6 · Physical Expressions of the LD3 → LD4 Boundary**

### **• Rock Cycle Stabilization**  
Sediment → sedimentary → metamorphic → igneous → crust → sediment  
This is recursion, not linear history.

### **• Plate Tectonics as Recursion**  
Boundaries migrate, fracture, fold, and renew along long-term μ_geo signatures.

### **• Mantle Convection**  
Heat delay (τ) forces structure to renew predictably.

### **• Magnetic Dynamo**  
The core retains μ_geo but rewrites under a stable τ-cycle.

These all appear first as LD3 memories,  
then become LD4 cycles.

---

## **7 · Conditions Required for Metamorphic Transition**

A planetary system reaches LD4 metamorphics only when:

1. **Solar LD4 recursion is stable**  
2. **Planetary internal heating is continuous**  
3. **τ-gradients (day–night, seasonal, orbital) are periodic**  
4. **The planet retains a crust–mantle–core hierarchy (Σ✧)**  
5. **μ_geo can be updated without erasure**

This is why metamorphics is **a planetary LD4 event**,  
not a continental or local one.

---

## **8 · What Metamorphics Is *Not***

- Not LDF (life recursion)  
- Not LDSF (shared mind)  
- Not LC1+ (continuity light)  
- Not symbolic or semantic  
- Not an emergent identity band  

It is **purely physical**,  
strictly LD3 → LD4,  
and must remain in the planetary recursion domain.

---

## **9 · Final Canonical Summary**

**LD3 → LD4 Metamorphics (Geology) is:**

- μ_geo becoming μ_geo′  
- τ-forcing becoming continuous  
- Σ✧ patterns entering cycles  
- crust–mantle–core memory becoming recursive  
- geology shifting from “remembered” to “self-renewing”

**It is the precise moment Earth becomes a recursive identity.**

All biological LD-bands require this to be in place.
