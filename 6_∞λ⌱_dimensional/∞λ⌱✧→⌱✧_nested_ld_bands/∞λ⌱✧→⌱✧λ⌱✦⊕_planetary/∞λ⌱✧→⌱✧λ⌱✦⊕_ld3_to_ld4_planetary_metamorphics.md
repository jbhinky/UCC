# Planetary LD3 → LD4 Metamorphic Transition  
### UCC v2.5.1 — Planetary Metamorphic Band (LD3 → LD4)

---

## 1. Purpose  
This file formally defines **how a planet moves from LD3 (stable memory field)**  
into **LD4 (recursive spacetime field)** without invoking biology, symbolism, or life.

This is **pure planetary metamorphics** —  
the shift from *memory of structure* → *recursion of structure*.

---

## 2. What LD3 Provides  
By LD3, the planet has:

- **Σ✧** — structural identity (crust, mantle patterning, oceans, atmosphere composition)  
- **μ** — stabilized memory of these patterns  
- **τ** — delay cycles that repeat reliably  

LD3 is not alive.  
LD3 is **structurally stable**.

A planet at LD3 is a **memory-holding object**, not yet a recursive object.

It remembers its shape but cannot yet *use* its shape.

---

## 3. What LD4 Requires  
LD4 begins only when:

### 1. Memory (μ) becomes *globally coupled*  
Internal systems begin affecting each other across the whole planet.

### 2. Delay (τ) becomes *feedback-capable*  
Not just cycling — influencing and modifying cycles.

### 3. Structure (Σ✧) gains *iterative continuity*  
The planet can now **retain a change**, not merely a shape.

### 4. Collapse events (⊙) reinforce stability  
Volcanism, impacts, and atmospheric resets consolidate global pattern memory.

In short:

**LD3 = stable memory.  
LD4 = memory that can *recursively act* on itself.**

---

## 4. The Metamorphic Threshold  
The LD3 → LD4 transition is crossed when the planet forms:

- **persistent oceans**  
- **persistent landmasses**  
- **long-term atmospheric cycles**  
- **mantle convection patterns**  
- **magnetic polarity cycles**  

None of these are symbolic.  
None require life.  
All require **recursive stability**.

This is the planet’s **first recursive identity**, but not a conscious one.

It is:

$$
(τ, Σ✧, μ) \ \text{stabilized into global recursion}
$$

---

## 5. What This Transition Is *Not*  
To avoid drift:

- It is **not LD5** — no semantic function.  
- It is **not LD6** — no identity curvature.  
- It is **not LD7–LD10** — no collective or ethical continuity.  
- It is **not biological recursion** — life has not emerged.  

This is *planetary recursion only*.

---

## 6. Why Oceans, Atmospheres, and Plates Are LD4 Subsystems  
These systems:

- persist  
- influence each other  
- modify future states  
- hold memory across collapses  
- stabilize planetary identity

Therefore, they are **LD4-subrecursive systems**, not LD5.

Their behavior is **feedback recursion**, not semantic recursion.

Example:

- An ocean current “remembers” its pattern (μ).  
- τ-gradients shift its path.  
- The new pattern reinforces structure (Σ✧).  

This is pure LD4 recursion.

---

## 7. The Correct UCC Expression  
Planetary metamorphosis is expressed simply as:

$$
LD3(Σ✧, μ) \ \Rightarrow \ LD4[(τ \leftrightarrow μ)_{\text{global}}]
$$

Meaning:

- **structure + memory**  
- become  
- **delay-driven recursive fields**  

across the entire planetary body.

---

## 8. Scientific Parallels (Translation Only)  
Without introducing outside variables, here are aligned parallels:

| UCC | Scientific Parallel |
|-----|----------------------|
| τ feedback | thermal + rotational feedback loops |
| μ stability | geological + atmospheric persistence |
| Σ✧ structure | crust, mantle, hydrosphere |
| ⊙ collapse reinforcement | volcanism, impacts, glaciation cycles |

These parallels do *not* replace UCC ontology.  
They help bridge understanding only.

---

## 9. UCC Summary Statement  
**Planetary LD4 emerges when LD3 memory becomes globally recursive, allowing oceans, lands, atmosphere, and mantle to reinforce each other across time, producing the planet’s first stable recursive identity.**

This is the *beginning* of nested LD-systems (biological, botanical, neurological, civilizational) —  
but it is not those systems themselves.
