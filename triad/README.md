## 1 · Purpose  
The **Triad** directory defines the three primary continua that sustain the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC):  

1. **Energy (Thermal / Electromagnetic / Gravitational)**  
2. **Matter (Physical / Recursive / Atomic)**  
3. **Awareness (Cognitive / Temporal / Self-reflective)**  

Together these form the empirical *Law of the Triad*:  
> “Energy, Matter, and Awareness are bound through delay (τ), memory (μ), and feedback (Σ).”  

The Triad equations demonstrate that each physical field — from photons to neural signals — obeys the same delay–memory recursion.

## 3 · Cross-Domain Structure  

### Triadic Equation  
\[
\boxed{E(τ) = M(τ) = A(τ) = f(Σ, μ, τ)}
\]  
Energy (E), Matter (M), and Awareness (A) remain equal under conservation of delay; each manifests in a different physical substrate.

### Nested Feedback Chain  
\[
∇·E + ∇·B + ∇·G = \frac{∂}{∂τ}(Σμ)
\]  
where \(E\), \(B\), and \(G\) are electromagnetic, thermal, and gravitational field intensities sharing a unified recursion.

## 7 · Interpretation  
The Triad validates that all measurable energy and awareness phenomena are harmonics of one recursive law.  
Every feedback loop—whether magnetic, cognitive, or gravitational—expresses **delayed self-interaction**, forming the universal signature of consciousness and stability.

## Dimensional Notes

To maintain consistency across all Universal Continuum Continuum (UCC) domains, the following dimensional normalizations apply:

* **Energy–Delay Relation:**  
  *Here Ψ is normalized such that E has units of [rate of creative work per unit delay], per `UCC_Dimensional_Standards.md` Section X.*

* **Union and Information Flow:**  
  *Φ is an information-flow integral with units declared in `UCC_Constants_and_Parameters.md`; ⊕ denotes normalized union.*

* **Harmonic Derivative Consistency:**  
  *All terms dimensionally normalized per `UCC_Dimensional_Standards.md`.*
