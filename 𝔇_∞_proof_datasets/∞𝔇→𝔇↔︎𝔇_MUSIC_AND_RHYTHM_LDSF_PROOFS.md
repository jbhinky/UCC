# MUSIC AND RHYTHM — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets (v2.5.1)

## Purpose

This document catalogs **peer-reviewable, externally verifiable datasets and measurement results** that support treating **music and rhythm** as a **shared, measurable field** (LDSF) in the strict empirical sense:

**shared-field claim → measurable variables → datasets/institutions → falsifiability conditions**.

This file contains **measured anchors only**:
- no normative claims
- no metaphysical claims
- no framework-dependent interpretation

---

## Shared-Field Claim Being Tested (Agnostic Form)

> **Claim:**  
> Rhythmic structure in music can be operationalized as **externally measurable timing/coordination structure** that (i) replicates across independent laboratories and (ii) can be characterized at population and corpus scales using standardized metrics and archived datasets.

---

## A. Quantitative Timing & Entrainment Anchors

### A1) Neural entrainment and beat-related frequency bands
**Measurable variables**
- stimulation frequency (Hz)
- steady-state response / frequency-tagged neural response (EEG/MEG)
- phase consistency / spectral peaks at beat and meter frequencies

**Representative reported regime**
- beat/meter-relevant periodicities commonly studied in approximately **sub-Hz to few-Hz** timing bands (e.g., beat-level rhythms and their metrical subdivisions/multiples), with frequency-tagging paradigms used to test entrainment to rhythmic regularities.  [oai_citation:0‡Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79738ce055314c10d2534c62e8990ed1c64b1a54?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it’s LDSF-relevant**
- these are instrument-measurable signals with published protocols and replication paths.

### A2) Behavioral synchronization (tapping / asynchrony)
**Measurable variables**
- inter-tap interval (ms)
- mean asynchrony (ms)
- variability (SD, CV)
- error rates under perturbations (phase shift, tempo change)

**Representative example class**
- polyrhythm/beat perception experiments quantify when participants can maintain a stable perceptual beat and synchronized action under structured rhythmic inputs.

## B. Cross-Cultural Corpora and Global Databases

### B1) Natural History of Song (NHS) / cross-cultural song datasets
**What is measured**
- coded song contexts (ethnographic annotations)
- structural and behavioral dimensions of song use
- cross-society distribution of song categories

**Peer-reviewed anchor**
- large-scale cross-cultural analyses reporting both **universality of presence** (music in sampled societies) and **quantified variation** across coded dimensions.  [oai_citation:2‡HRAF](https://hraf.yale.edu/ehc/documents/1260?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**LDSF-relevant output types**
- codebooks (variable definitions)
- society-level sampling frames
- reproducible statistical summaries of distributions

### B2) The Global Jukebox / Cantometrics (quantified style codings)
**What is measured**
- standardized feature codings across songs (style/performance dimensions)
- cross-society distributions of coded musical variables

**Reported scale (dataset description)**
- **5,776 songs** from **1,026 societies**, with standardized codings across multiple aspects of performance/style.  [oai_citation:3‡PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0275469&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it’s LDSF-relevant**
- enables large-N, cross-cultural distribution tests of measurable rhythmic/performative features using a single standardized coding framework.

### B3) Statistical “universals” as distributions (not absolutes)
**What is measured**
- feature distributions across a global recording sample
- statistical regularities (e.g., common structural/function patterns expressed as distributions)

**Peer-reviewed anchor**
- global-scale analysis reporting “statistical universals” framed as distributional tendencies, not culture-erasing absolutes. 

### B4) Cross-cultural rhythm cognition (participant-group priors)
**What is measured**
- inferred rhythm priors / internal representations across participant groups
- cross-group similarity and divergence quantified from behavioral data

**Peer-reviewed anchor**
- cross-cultural work estimating rhythm priors across multiple participant groups (including Indigenous populations), providing a quantitative “shared vs. variable” decomposition.  [oai_citation:4‡Brandeis ScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Commonality-and-variation-in-mental-representations/9924337687101921?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## C. Minimal Variable Set for Empirical LDSF Testing

These variables are sufficient to test “shared measurable field” claims without importing interpretive meaning:

### C1) Timing variables (signal-level)
- event onset times (ms)
- inter-onset interval distributions (ms)
- tempo estimates (BPM)
- modulation spectra / periodicity peaks (Hz)

### C2) Coordination variables (group/observer-level)
- synchronization error distributions (ms)
- phase locking metrics (unitless)
- population-level preferred tempo distributions (BPM)

### C3) Corpus variables (archive-level)
- feature-code distributions (counts, proportions)
- annotation reliability metrics (inter-rater agreement, where provided)
- sampling frame metadata (society, region, recording context)

## D. Empirical Validation Map (Claim → Test → Dataset Class → Pass Condition)

| Claim fragment (agnostic) | Testable variable(s) | Dataset class | Empirical pass condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rhythmic timing has measurable periodic structure | IOIs, tempo, spectral peaks | lab entrainment + behavioral timing datasets | replicated periodicity metrics within reported uncertainty |
| Humans synchronize within measurable error bounds | mean asynchrony, variance | tapping / perturbation paradigms | replicated distributions across labs/tasks  [oai_citation:5‡Brandeis ScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Commonality-and-variation-in-mental-representations/9924337687101921?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Music corpora show structured distributions | coded feature distributions | Global Jukebox/Cantometrics | non-degenerate distributions reproduce across samples  [oai_citation:6‡PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0275469&utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Cross-cultural presence + diversity are quantifiable | coded contexts + clustering | NHS-type datasets | documented coding + reproducible cross-society summaries  [oai_citation:7‡HRAF](https://hraf.yale.edu/ehc/documents/1260?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Cross-group rhythm priors are measurable | inferred priors + divergence | cross-cultural cognition datasets | published model checks + cross-group comparability  [oai_citation:8‡Brandeis ScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Commonality-and-variation-in-mental-representations/9924337687101921?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

---

## E. Falsifiability Conditions (Non-negotiable)

The LDSF classification for Music/Rhythm (as defined here: “externally measurable shared field structure”) must be revised or narrowed if any of the following occur:

1. **Replication failure:** key timing/synchronization effects fail multi-lab replication under comparable protocols (within uncertainty bounds).
2. **Corpus unreliability:** major cross-cultural corpora fail reliability audits (e.g., coding agreement, sampling transparency) such that distribution claims cannot be defended.  [oai_citation:9‡PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0275469&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Method invalidation:** primary measurement methods (EEG frequency-tagging paradigms, standardized tapping paradigms, corpus coding standards) are shown to be systematically non-comparable across studies.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted: failing components are removed or rewritten to match what remains empirically supported.
