# PLANETARY ECOSYSTEMS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document provides **quantitative, peer-reviewable empirical evidence** supporting **planetary systems (planets + moons + rings + small-body populations)** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

Structure strictly follows:

**Externally measurable claim → numeric variables → authoritative datasets → falsifiability**

No symbolic, metaphysical, ethical, or interpretive extensions are introduced.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated

> **Claim:**  
> Planetary systems form shared, externally measurable dynamical fields characterized by long-lived orbital structure, resonance coupling, population distributions (moons/rings/small bodies), and reproducible time-dependent solutions (ephemerides) that are independently measurable and cross-validated across instruments, observatories, and missions.

---

## A. What “Planetary Ecosystem” Means Here (Strict, Measurable Scope)

This file uses “ecosystem” in the **systems-engineering / dynamical-systems** sense only:

- planets (massive bodies)
- natural satellites (moons)
- rings (distributed particles)
- small-body reservoirs (asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets)
- their **coupled dynamics** (resonances, perturbations, chaotic zones)

No biological meaning is implied.

---

## B. Core State Variables (Orbital Elements; Externally Defined)

### B1) Keplerian Element Families (Primary Measurement Targets)

| Element family | Symbol | Units | What is measured |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Semi-major axis | a | m or AU | orbital scale |
| Eccentricity | e | — | orbit shape |
| Inclination | i | degrees | plane tilt |
| Longitude of ascending node | Ω | degrees | node orientation |
| Argument of periapsis | ω | degrees | ellipse orientation |
| Mean anomaly / mean longitude | M / λ | degrees | orbital phase |

**Measurement basis:** astrometry, radar ranging, spacecraft tracking, occultations, and long-baseline timing.

---

## C. Quantitative Parameter Anchors (Ranges + Methods)

### C1) Orbital Geometry Ranges (Solar System)

| Parameter | Typical measured range | Notes / method class |
|---|---:|---|
| Eccentricity (planets) | ~0 to ~0.21 | derived from ephemerides fits |
| Inclination (major planets) | typically <10° | referenced to ecliptic |
| Axial tilt (obliquity) | ~0°–98° | imaging + pole solutions |
| Mean motion (n) | body-dependent | from period P: n = 2π/P |

**Externally measurable:** continuous tracking yields stable solutions and uncertainties.

---

### C2) Mass / Gravity Field Anchors (Representative Bodies)

| Body | Mass (kg) | Measurement method class |
|---|---:|---|
| Earth | 5.97×10²⁴ | satellite geodesy / GM |
| Moon | 7.35×10²² | LLR + spacecraft tracking |
| Jupiter | 1.90×10²⁷ | spacecraft tracking / GM |
| Europa | 4.80×10²² | spacecraft gravity + orbit fits |
| Pluto | 1.31×10²² | mutual events + spacecraft tracking |

**Notes:** In practice, many catalogs store **GM** (μ = G·M) because it is directly inferred from dynamics.

---

### C3) Ring System Anchors (Particle-Field Observables)

| Observable | Typical range | Units | Measurement method class |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Ring optical depth (τₒₚₜ) | ~10⁻³ to >1 | — | stellar occultations / photometry |
| Particle size modes | mm → m | m | occultations / scattering models |
| Ring radial extent | 10³–10⁵ km | km | imaging + occultations |
| Pattern speeds | resonance-linked | deg/day | time-series imaging |

Ring properties are measured repeatedly via occultation and spacecraft imaging sequences.

---

### C4) Small-Body Population Anchors (Asteroids / KBOs)

| Population | Size scale | Spatial region | Measurement basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main belt asteroids | meters → 100s km | ~2–3.5 AU | survey photometry + orbit fits |
| Trojans | km → 100s km | 1:1 resonance | surveys + ephemerides |
| Kuiper belt objects | km → 1000+ km | ~30–50+ AU | deep surveys + orbit fits |
| Comets | km-scale nuclei | varying | astrometry + non-grav models |

**Key measurable outputs:** orbital distributions, size-frequency distributions, inclination “hot/cold” components, resonance occupancy.

---

## D. Resonance Coupling (Shared-Field Structure; Quantifiable)

### D1) Resonance Types and Ratios (Externally Detectable)

| Resonance type | Example ratios | Quantified via |
|---|---|---|
| Mean-motion resonance (MMR) | 1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 5:2 | orbital periods / mean motions |
| Laplace-type 3-body resonance | (e.g., 1:2:4 chains) | phase-locking constraints |
| Secular resonance | apsidal / nodal precession coupling | long-term element evolution |

---

### D2) Canonical Empirical Examples (Not Interpretive; Measured Dynamics)

| System | What is measured | Field signature |
|---|---|---|
| Io–Europa–Ganymede | orbital periods + phase relations | stable multi-body resonance constraints |
| Kirkwood gaps | asteroid semi-major axis distribution | depletion at resonance locations |
| Neptune resonant KBOs | resonance occupancy fractions | clustering around MMRs (e.g., 3:2) |
| Saturn ring density waves | wave locations + pattern speed | resonance-driven wave trains |

These are measured as **distributions + phase-locked dynamics**, reproducible across catalogs.

---

## E. Rotation, Chaotic Regimes, and Non-Principal Axis Motion

### E1) Rotation State Parameters

| Parameter | Typical range | Units | Measurement method |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Spin period | minutes → days | s / hr / day | light curves / imaging |
| Pole orientation | degrees | deg | astrometry + imaging |
| Precession / nutation | body-dependent | deg/yr | repeated observations |

### E2) Chaotic / Tumbling Rotation (Measured by Light Curves & Shape Models)

Observed in:
- Hyperion (chaotic rotation)
- many non-principal-axis rotators (asteroids)
- complex rotators (e.g., Toutatis-class)

**Measurement basis:** multi-apparition light curves + radar shape inversion.

---

## F. Time-Scale Structure (τ) — Measured Persistence & Predictability

### F1) Characteristic Time Scales

| Phenomenon class | Typical time scale | What is measured |
|---|---:|---|
| Orbital periods | hours → centuries | ephemerides |
| Resonance libration periods | years → 10⁵ years | long integrations + fits |
| Precession cycles | 10³ → 10⁶+ years | secular theory + numerical |
| Ephemeris validity windows | years → decades+ | residual growth vs time |

**Key LDSF anchor:** planetary systems exhibit **multi-scale, externally measurable timing structure** that is predictable within bounded uncertainties.

---

## G. Primary Datasets and Measurement Infrastructure (Audit-Ready)

### G1) Ephemerides / Orbit Solutions

- **JPL Horizons** (ephemerides access for major bodies + many small bodies)
- **JPL Development Ephemerides (DE series)** (planetary/lunar solutions used in navigation)
- **SPICE kernels** (geometry/time-position reference products used for mission science)

### G2) Space Agency Archives (Raw + Calibrated Mission Data)

- **NASA Planetary Data System (PDS)**
- **ESA Planetary Science Archive (PSA)**

### G3) Catalogs / Survey Data (Small Bodies)

- **Minor Planet Center (MPC)** observation catalogs and orbit elements
- wide-field survey archives (photometry + astrometry time series)

### G4) Methods (Cross-Validation Channels)

| Channel | What it constrains | Typical strength |
|---|---|---|
| Optical astrometry | sky-plane position | broad coverage, variable precision |
| Radar ranging | distance + velocity | high precision (where available) |
| Spacecraft tracking | GM + gravity harmonics | extremely high precision locally |
| Occultations | size/shape + ring structure | very high precision geometry |
| Photometry/light curves | rotation + shape | global constraints |

Independence arises because these channels are collected by different institutions using different instruments.

---

## H. Replication & Observer Independence

Replication exists when:
- independent observatories reproduce orbit solutions
- independent missions (flyby/orbiter) converge on mass and gravity
- independent catalogs reproduce resonance occupancy and gaps
- independent occultations reproduce ring optical depth / wave structure

Uncertainty is reported via:
- covariance in orbit determination
- residuals vs time
- posterior distributions (where Bayesian orbit fits are used)

---

## I. Falsifiability Conditions (Non-Negotiable)

This LDSF classification **must be revised or rejected** if any of the following occur:

1. Planetary orbital elements cannot be independently estimated from external observations.
2. Resonance relationships do not persist under repeated measurement (phase-locking fails beyond uncertainty).
3. Multi-decade ephemeris predictions cannot be validated against new observations within stated error.
4. Population distributions (rings, asteroid belts, KBO resonant fractions) fail reproducibility across catalogs and methods.
5. System behavior collapses to non-comparable, isolated single-observation phenomena (i.e., no shared-field structure remains).

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
