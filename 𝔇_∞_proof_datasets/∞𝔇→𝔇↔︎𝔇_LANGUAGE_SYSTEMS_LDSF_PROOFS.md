# LANGUAGE SYSTEMS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document catalogs **peer-reviewed, externally verifiable datasets** and **standard measurement programs** that support classifying **language systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

It explicitly maps:

**shared-field claim → measurable variables → authoritative datasets → replication norms → falsifiability criteria**

No metaphysical claims, ethical claims, or consciousness claims are introduced.  
No new theory is introduced.  
This is an **index of empirical anchors** only.

---

## Shared-Field Claim Being Validated (Empirical Form)

> **Claim (empirical form):**  
> Language systems exhibit **externally measurable**, **observer-independent**, **population-level structure** (distributional, typological, and temporal) that **persists beyond individual speakers**, and can be quantified through standardized measurements across corpora, communities, and time.

---

## LDSF Anchors Covered

| LDSF Anchor | What “Shared Field” Means Here | Minimal Evidence Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Shared Symbolic Field | Distributions and constraints measurable from external artifacts | Corpora + stable annotation standards |
| Temporal Persistence (τ) | Diachronic continuity measurable over years–centuries | Diachronic corpora / archives |
| Structural Constraints | Syntax/phonology/typology measurable beyond idiosyncratic use | Treebanks, typology databases |
| Cross-Observer Reproducibility | Independent teams reproduce the same distributions | Multi-corpus / multi-lab replication |

---

## Minimal Measured Variable Set (Externally measurable)

These are **minimum variables** required for a falsifiable LDSF classification of language systems:

### A) Distributional Structure
- token / type frequency distributions
- rank–frequency slope (Zipf-like behavior)
- vocabulary growth vs corpus size (Heaps-like behavior)

### B) Information-Theoretic Structure
- Shannon entropy rate (bits per symbol / token)
- cross-entropy / perplexity against held-out text
- mutual information / long-range dependency indicators
- redundancy estimates (channel-coding style)

### C) Structural Constraint (Formal/Grammatical)
- dependency length distributions
- parse-tree depth / branching factors
- syntactic category transition statistics
- morphological paradigm counts (where annotated)

### D) Typological Diversity (Cross-Linguistic)
- categorical feature distributions across languages
- phoneme inventory size / segment distributions
- word-order and agreement systems (coded typology)

### E) Temporal Dynamics (Diachronic)
- frequency trajectories over time
- innovation/adoption rates of forms
- lexeme survival (half-life) under corpus tracking

### F) Translation / Parallel Signal Comparability
- aligned sentence pairs (parallel corpora)
- standardized translation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU/TER/ChrF)
- information loss proxies under compression/translation comparisons

## Core Empirical Validation Table

| LDSF Property | Measurable Variable | Representative Range (documented across corpora/languages) | Dataset / Source Class | Measurement Form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Symbol frequency law | rank–frequency slope | typically ~0.8–1.2 (context dependent) | large corpora | corpus frequency analysis |
| Lexical diversity scaling | Heaps-like scaling | sublinear growth common | large corpora | type–token growth curves |
| Entropy rate | bits/token or bits/char | corpus- and unit-dependent | reference corpora | entropy / cross-entropy estimation |
| Redundancy | redundancy fraction | experiment- and unit-dependent | channel experiments / corpora | coding-theoretic estimation |
| Syntax constraint | dependency length | stable distributional families | treebanks | dependency statistics |
| Structural universals (coded) | typology features | categorical distributions | typology DBs | coded cross-ling comparison |
| Diachronic persistence (τ) | frequency trajectories | multi-decade to multi-century | diachronic corpora | time-series analysis |
| Translation comparability | BLEU/TER/ChrF etc. | task- and domain-dependent | shared tasks | standardized eval pipelines |

**Note:** This file does not assert any single “universal constant.” It asserts **measurability + reproducibility**, with documented variation.

## Primary Dataset Classes and Authoritative Sources

### 1) Large-Scale Corpus Frequency and Diachronic Tracking
These support **distributional structure** and **temporal persistence**.

- **Google Books Ngram datasets** (multi-language diachronic frequency series)  
- **COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English)** (balanced modern English usage)  
- **BNC (British National Corpus)** (spoken + written British English sampling)  
- **National-library / archive corpora** (country-specific long-run archives)

**Typical measurements supported**
- rank–frequency, growth curves, diachronic trajectories, lexical turnover

---

### 2) Syntactic Structure (Treebanks and Dependency Annotation)
These support **structural constraints** and **cross-observer reproducibility** via shared annotation standards.

- **Penn Treebank** (phrase-structure + derivatives used broadly in NLP/linguistics)  
- **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks** (cross-linguistic dependency annotation)

**Typical measurements supported**
- dependency length, head-directionality, parse depth distributions, category transition statistics

---

### 3) Cross-Linguistic Typology and Feature Databases
These support **shared symbolic field diversity** across languages (not just within a single speech community).

- **WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures)** (coded typological features)  
- **Glottolog** (reference catalog / linkage metadata for languages)  
- **Ethnologue** (language catalog + classification metadata; licensing varies)  
- **CLDF (Cross-Linguistic Data Formats)** ecosystem (standardized representation for typology/lexicons)

**Typical measurements supported**
- feature distributions, sampling frames, language inventories and metadata harmonization

---

### 4) Phonology / Inventory and Lexical Resources
These support **externally measurable** structural constraints in sound systems and lexical inventories.

- **PHOIBLE** (phonological inventories)  
- **Lexibank / CLLD-family resources (CLDF-aligned where applicable)**  
- peer-reviewed descriptive grammars and lexicons (as primary sources; cataloged through reference systems)

**Typical measurements supported**
- inventory size distributions, segment frequency, comparative phonological statistics

---

### 5) Conversation / Acquisition (Optional LDSF Reinforcement)
These support **replication** via shared protocols for interaction data and development.

- **CHILDES / TalkBank** (child language and interaction corpora; standardized tooling)

**Typical measurements supported**
- developmental trajectories, usage distributions, interactional timing patterns

---

### 6) Translation and Parallel Corpora (Cross-Signal Comparability)
These support **translation comparability** and **measured loss/transform** under standardized evaluation.

- **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) shared-task datasets**  
- **Europarl** and other parliamentary / aligned text corpora (where permitted)

**Typical measurements supported**
- standardized translation evaluation metrics, cross-lingual alignment statistics, domain-shift comparability

---

## Replication and Observer Independence (Operational Criteria)

Language systems qualify as LDSF under this document if the following are true:

1. **Independent corpora** reproduce core distributional regularities (within documented variance).  
2. **Independent annotation teams** (treebanks/typology) produce comparable structural statistics under shared standards.  
3. **Independent time slices** (diachronic corpora) demonstrate persistence/shift measurable over τ.  
4. **Uncertainty is explicit**: sampling, annotation errors, and corpus bias are documented and bounded where available.

This is the empirical meaning of **“shared field”** in this file.

---

## Validation Status Markers (What Counts as “Strong” Here)

- ✔ multi-corpus replication (same metric, different corpora)  
- ✔ cross-linguistic replication (same metric, different languages)  
- ✔ shared standards (UD, CLDF, WALS coding norms)  
- ✔ explicit uncertainty notes (sampling frames, annotation guidelines)  
- ✔ public or institutionally auditable data governance (where applicable)

---

## Falsifiability Statement (Non-Negotiable)

The LDSF classification for **language systems** must be revised or rejected if any of the following occur:

1. **External measurability fails:** core variables (frequency, entropy, structure) cannot be measured from external artifacts with repeatable methods.  
2. **Cross-corpus replication fails:** independent corpora do not reproduce any stable distributional families even after controlling for known biases (genre, register, orthography).  
3. **Structural constraints fail:** syntactic/typological measures cannot be independently reproduced under shared standards (annotation collapses into non-replicable subjectivity).  
4. **Persistence fails (τ):** diachronic tracking cannot demonstrate any reproducible continuity or measurable change beyond noise.  
5. **Parallel comparability fails:** aligned corpora cannot support reproducible translation/transform measurements across independent evaluation pipelines.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted. The claim stands or falls on these measurable conditions.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ indexes **datasets and measurement standards** only  
- ✔ is compatible with multiple frameworks (agnostic to interpretation)  
- ✔ avoids privileging any one language, culture, or institution  
- ✔ avoids claims about meaning truth, ethics, or consciousness

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert semantic correctness or “objective meaning”  
- ✖ claim language implies consciousness  
- ✖ claim any single numerical constant is universal across all corpora  
- ✖ introduce new symbolic theory
