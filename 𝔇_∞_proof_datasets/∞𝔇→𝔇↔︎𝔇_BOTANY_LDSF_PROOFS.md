# BOTANY — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally produced, peer-reviewed, and observational datasets** that empirically ground the classification of **botany as a Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **no interpretation**
- catalogs **externally generated datasets only**

All sources listed are **independent**, **verifiable**, and **repeatable**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

In legacy UCC versions (≤ 2.5.0), plant-mediated shared fields were referenced under **LD6 (shared field map)**.

As of **UCC 2.5.1**, botany as a shared field is classified as **LDSF1**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator** between:
- **LD** (biophysical substrate: matter, chemistry, physiology), and
- **LDSF** (shared plant field behavior measurable across many organisms and landscapes).

---

## Dataset Selection Rules (Audit Constraints)

Only datasets meeting the following are indexed:
- produced by **recognized scientific institutions / consortia**
- formal documentation and/or dataset papers exist
- variables include explicit definitions and, where applicable, uncertainty metadata
- data are reproducible and publicly accessible

Remote sensing products are included only where there is established calibration/validation practice and transparent product documentation.

## LDSF1 — Shared Plant-Mediated Coordination Fields

### Dataset Domains

| Domain | Description | Spatial Scale |
|---|---|---|
| Primary productivity | Photosynthetic carbon fixation and biomass production | Local → Global |
| Phenology | Seasonal timing of plant life cycles | Local → Continental |
| Vegetation structure | Biomass, canopy, land cover | Regional → Global |
| Land–atmosphere exchange | Evapotranspiration, albedo, energy/CO₂ exchange | Local → Global |
| Carbon storage | Aboveground biomass and long-term carbon pools | Regional → Global |

---

## Primary Empirical Sources

### 1. Global Vegetation Condition and Productivity (Remote Sensing)

| Dataset / Product Class | Provider / Steward | Measured Quantities (examples) |
|---|---|---|
| MODIS Vegetation Indices (NDVI/EVI) | NASA | NDVI/EVI (unitless), seasonal greenness |
| MODIS NPP / GPP products (e.g., MOD17 family) | NASA (distributed via data archives) | GPP, NPP (g C m⁻² time⁻¹) |
| ESA CCI Land Cover | ESA | Land cover classes; change over time |

---

### 2. Phenology and Seasonal Timing (Ground + Network Observations)

| Dataset | Provider / Steward | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) | USA-NPN / partners | Leaf-out, flowering, senescence dates |
| PEP725 European Phenology Database | European consortium | Phenophase timing across species/regions |
| PhenoCam Network | Research consortium | Canopy greenness indices; time series |

---

### 3. Carbon, Water, and Energy Exchange (Ecosystem Flux)

| Dataset / Network | Provider / Steward | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| FLUXNET (eddy covariance synthesis) | Global consortium | NEE (g C m⁻² time⁻¹), latent/sensible heat, H₂O flux |
| Forest inventory / biomass assessments (national + global syntheses) | Multiple agencies | Biomass density (Mg ha⁻¹), carbon stocks |
| FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) | FAO | Forest extent, biomass/carbon reporting metrics |

**Scope clarification:**  
Flux networks and forest assessments are treated as **shared-field evidence** for plant-mediated exchange and storage at landscape scales (LDSF). They are not used to infer internal experience.

---

### 4. Plant Traits, Distributions, and Reproductive Constraints

| Dataset | Provider / Steward | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| TRY Plant Trait Database | Global consortium | Trait distributions (leaf, root, growth traits) |
| BIEN (Botanical Information and Ecology Network) | Consortium | Species distributions and occurrences |
| Kew Seed Information Database (SID) | Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | Seed traits, dormancy class, dispersal-relevant traits |

---

## Measured Variables (Representative)

| Variable | Typical Units / Form | Example Dataset Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| NDVI / EVI | unitless index | MODIS VI |
| GPP / NPP | g C m⁻² day⁻¹ / yr⁻¹ (product-dependent) | MODIS productivity products |
| Leaf Area Index (LAI) | m² m⁻² | satellite-derived products / field validation literature |
| Phenological dates | day-of-year (DOY) | USA-NPN; PEP725 |
| Evapotranspiration proxies / flux | mm time⁻¹ or W m⁻² equivalents | FLUXNET |
| Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) | g C m⁻² time⁻¹ | FLUXNET |
| Aboveground biomass (AGB) | Mg ha⁻¹ | forest inventories / syntheses |
| Land cover class | categorical | ESA CCI Land Cover |

All variables are **externally measured** and **population / landscape-scaled**.

---

## Quantitative Anchor Table (Non-Interpretive)

| Botanical LDSF Claim | Measured Quantity | Units / Form | Dataset Anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vegetation state varies coherently in space/time | NDVI/EVI time series | unitless | MODIS VI |
| Plant production is measurable at scale | NPP/GPP | g C m⁻² time⁻¹ | MODIS productivity products |
| Seasonal timing is measurable across regions | phenophase DOY | day-of-year | USA-NPN; PEP725; PhenoCam |
| Plants exchange CO₂/H₂O/energy with the environment | NEE; H₂O flux; latent heat | g C m⁻² time⁻¹; mm time⁻¹; W m⁻² | FLUXNET |
| Vegetation structure and land cover are classifiable | land cover / canopy metrics | categorical / continuous | ESA CCI Land Cover (+ supporting products) |
| Seed and trait constraints can be measured across taxa | trait distributions | measured traits by type | TRY; Kew SID |

---

## Validation Status

- Satellite and ground-based cross-validation is standard practice for many products
- Longitudinal datasets span multi-decadal observation windows in key regions
- Measurement protocols and product documentation are publicly available
- Uncertainty bounds and caveats are published by dataset stewards where applicable

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for botany must be revised if:

- core plant-field observables (productivity, phenology, exchange fluxes, vegetation state) cannot be measured reproducibly across independent programs, or
- purported shared-field regularities fail replication across regions or time under documented measurement methods.

No reinterpretation of data is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors botany as a **shared measurable field**
- ✔ supports independent audit and replication
- ✔ remains ethically constrained under Shepherd

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ infer intention
- ✖ merge symbolism with data
