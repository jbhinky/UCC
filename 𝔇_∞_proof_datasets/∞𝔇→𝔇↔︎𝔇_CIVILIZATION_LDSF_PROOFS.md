# CIVILIZATION — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally produced, peer-reviewed, archaeological, historical, and institutional datasets** that empirically support the classification of **civilization** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no interpretation**
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **traceable empirical anchors only**

All datasets listed are **independently produced**, **auditable**, and **verifiable without reference to subjective experience**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

In legacy UCC models (≤ 2.5.0), large-scale human systems were often grouped under **LD7–LD9**.

As of **UCC v2.5.1**, civilization-scale coordination is explicitly classified as **LDSF2–LDSF4**, with:
- **LD** describing physical substrates (materials, geography, bodies),
- **LD5** acting as the structural union operator, and
- **LDSF** describing **shared, externally observable coordination fields** across populations and generations.

---

## LDSF Domain Coverage

| LDSF Subrange | Empirical Domain |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **LDSF2** | Social coordination at population scale |
| **LDSF3** | Shared symbolic, institutional, and economic systems |
| **LDSF4** | Long-duration civilizational continuity and transformation |

---

## Primary Empirical Domains and Datasets

### A. Archaeology and Settlement Systems

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) | Society for American Archaeology | site location, occupation layers, artifact density |
| Archaeology Data Service (ADS) | UK Research Councils | settlement chronology, material culture |
| Pleiades Gazetteer | ISAW (NYU) | geospatial continuity of places |

**Representative measures:**  
- settlement duration (years–centuries)  
- spatial clustering (km²)  
- artifact stratigraphy depth  

---

### B. Infrastructure and Built Environment

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) | European Commission | built-up area, population grids |
| World Bank Infrastructure Indicators | World Bank | transport, water, energy access |
| Historical OpenStreetMap Archives | OSM Foundation | network growth, connectivity |

**Representative measures:**  
- urban extent (km²)  
- infrastructure density  
- connectivity indices  

---

### C. Economic and Institutional Systems

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Maddison Project Database | University of Groningen | GDP, GDP per capita (historical) |
| World Development Indicators | World Bank | economic output, trade |
| OECD Historical Statistics | OECD | institutional performance |

**Representative measures:**  
- economic output (PPP-adjusted)  
- institutional longevity  
- systemic shocks and recoveries  

---

### D. Governance, Law, and Political Structure

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Polity IV Project | Center for Systemic Peace | regime transitions, authority patterns |
| Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) | V-Dem Institute | governance indicators |
| Comparative Constitutions Project | CCP | constitutional persistence |

**Representative measures:**  
- governance duration (years)  
- institutional change frequency  
- legal continuity metrics  

---

### E. Demography and Long-Term Continuity

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Human Mortality Database | MPIDR / UC Berkeley | mortality, longevity |
| Clio Infra | IISG | population, income, inequality |
| UN DESA Historical Estimates | United Nations | population size, growth |

**Representative measures:**  
- population size and density  
- growth rates  
- demographic transitions  

---

## Quantitative Anchor Table (Index Only)

| Civilization Claim (LDSF) | Observable Quantity | Units / Form | Dataset Classes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Civilization persists beyond individuals | settlement duration | years–centuries | ADS; tDAR |
| Coordination scales supra-locally | urban extent | km² | GHSL |
| Shared systems govern behavior | institutional lifespan | years | Polity IV; CCP |
| Economic activity propagates | GDP trajectories | indexed units | Maddison Project |
| Demography exhibits continuity | population size | counts / rates | UN DESA; HMD |

---

## Validation Status

- multi-disciplinary replication across archaeology, economics, political science
- independent archival verification
- datasets span **centuries to millennia**
- uncertainty, revision history, and provenance documented by source institutions

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for civilization must be revised if:
- civilization-scale coordination cannot be empirically demonstrated,
- institutional persistence fails independent replication,
- or civilizational dynamics collapse into isolated, non-shared LD-only processes.

No reinterpretation of datasets is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors civilization as a **shared external coordination field**
- ✔ supports independent audit and replication
- ✔ remains ethically constrained under Shepherd

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness or intent
- ✖ define meaning or values
- ✖ introduce symbolic or metaphysical claims
