# GEOLOGIC SYSTEMS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document catalogs **externally generated, instrument-validated, and reproducible datasets** supporting the classification of **geologic systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** in **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no new theory**
- performs **no interpretation**
- indexes **measured, falsifiable observations only**

All sources are independently maintained by recognized scientific institutions and are auditable across observers.

## LDSF1 — Foundational Shared Planetary Field

Geologic systems qualify as **LDSF1** by meeting the minimal criterion:

> **Externally measurable, persistent material/energy dynamics that exist as shared planetary processes independent of any single local event or observer.**

### LDSF1 Evidence Classes

| Property | Empirical Basis |
|--------|------------------|
| Persistent reservoirs | crust, mantle, core, lithosphere, asthenosphere |
| Shared forcing | gravity, heat flow, stress accumulation |
| External observability | seismic waves, deformation, eruption products, gravity fields |
| Temporal continuity (τ) | seconds → centuries → geological time |

---

## LDSF2 — Coupled Earth-Interior / Surface Dynamics

Geologic systems participate in **LDSF2 coupling** when LDSF1 processes link multiple planetary domains:

- plate motion ↔ seismicity ↔ volcanism
- deformation ↔ gravity anomalies ↔ mass redistribution
- mantle convection ↔ surface topography ↔ ocean basin evolution
- tectonics ↔ long-term geochemical fluxes (linked to separate geochemical-cycle proofs)

This is not an interpretation claim—only a statement that **measured datasets exist across coupled domains**.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated

> **Claim:**  
> Earth’s geological processes form shared planetary fields characterized by persistent, measurable material and energy flows across spatial and temporal scales.

## Empirical Validation Table

| UCC Aspect | Observable Variable | Dataset / Institution | Measurement Method | Replication |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Plate motion | velocity vectors (mm–cm/yr) | EarthScope / UNAVCO + global GNSS | continuous geodesy | global |
| Crustal deformation | strain rate, uplift/subsidence | InSAR (Sentinel-1), GNSS solutions | radar interferometry + geodesy | multi-platform |
| Seismic activity | magnitude, depth, focal mechanisms | USGS + ISC + GCMT | global seismograph networks | continuous |
| Volcanic processes | eruption timing, VEI, composition | Smithsonian GVP + WOVOdat | field + satellite + observatory logs | global |
| Earth structure | seismic velocity models, discontinuities | IRIS / EarthScope data products | tomography + waveform inversion | cross-lab |
| Heat flow | geothermal gradient, heat flux | International Heat Flow Commission | borehole + marine probe | global |
| Gravity / mass change | gravity anomalies, mass redistribution | GRACE / GRACE-FO, GOCE | satellite gravimetry | global |

All variables are **externally measurable**, **observer-independent**, and **repeatable**.

## Primary Measured Domains

| Domain | What is directly measured | LDSF Role |
|------|----------------------------|----------|
| Plate tectonics | motion, boundary deformation | shared kinematic field |
| Seismology | wave propagation, recurrence | shared stress-release field |
| Volcanology | eruption frequency, gas/ash, lava chemistry | deep–surface coupling |
| Geodesy & InSAR | surface displacement, strain | shared deformation field |
| Heat flow | conductive/advective flux | shared energetic baseline |
| Gravity fields | mass distribution changes | shared planetary redistribution |

---

## Domain-Specific Evidence

### 1. Plate Tectonics (τ)

**Measured**
- plate velocities (vector fields)
- boundary deformation rates
- rigid-plate and non-rigid strain patterns

**Primary Data Sources**
- EarthScope / UNAVCO geodetic archives  
- Global GNSS networks and combined solutions (IGS)  
- Plate-motion model products (e.g., MORVEL / NUVEL-style reference models)

**Why it supports LDSF**
- motion fields persist across decades
- independent replication across labs and instruments
- not reducible to isolated local LD events

---

### 2. Seismology

**Measured**
- event catalogs (time, location, magnitude)
- waveform propagation
- focal mechanisms and moment tensors
- aftershock statistics / recurrence intervals

**Primary Data Sources**
- USGS earthquake catalogs  
- International Seismological Centre (ISC) catalogs  
- Global CMT (GCMT) project  
- IRIS / EarthScope waveform archives

**Why it supports LDSF**
- global stress accumulation and release is observable as shared field behavior
- datasets are continuous and independently cross-checked

---

### 3. Volcanology

**Measured**
- eruption dates and magnitudes (VEI)
- eruption products and compositions
- deformation and gas flux signals (observatory monitoring)

**Primary Data Sources**
- Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program (GVP)  
- WOVOdat (volcano observatory datasets)  
- Satellite thermal/gas monitoring programs (multi-agency)

**Why it supports LDSF**
- volcanism is measurable as a coupled outcome of deep Earth energy and material transport
- observed patterns persist beyond single eruptions and across regions

---

### 4. Crustal Structure and Earth Interior

**Measured**
- seismic velocity distributions (Vp, Vs)
- discontinuity depths (Moho, 410/660 km)
- anisotropy and attenuation

**Primary Data Sources**
- IRIS / EarthScope seismology archives and derived products  
- Global tomography model repositories (peer-reviewed)

**Why it supports LDSF**
- Earth structure is inferred from reproducible wave physics
- independent inversions converge within uncertainty bounds

---

### 5. Heat Flow and Energetics

**Measured**
- heat flux (mW/m²)
- geothermal gradients
- regional conductive/advective anomalies

**Primary Data Sources**
- International Heat Flow Commission (IHFC) datasets  
- Borehole datasets and marine probe compilations

**Why it supports LDSF**
- provides a persistent energetic baseline driving geologic dynamics
- globally compiled, independently measured, uncertainty-reported

---

### 6. Gravity / Mass Redistribution

**Measured**
- gravitational field anomalies
- time-variable mass redistribution signals (e.g., ice loss, hydrology, postseismic effects)

**Primary Data Sources**
- GRACE / GRACE-FO time series  
- GOCE gravity field models

**Why it supports LDSF**
- planetary-scale redistribution is externally measurable and shared across observers

---

## Representative Measured Variables

- plate velocity vectors (mm–cm/yr)
- surface displacement (mm–m) and strain rate (1/yr)
- earthquake magnitude (Mw), depth (km), recurrence rates
- seismic wave velocities (Vp, Vs), attenuation (Q)
- eruption frequency, VEI, ash/gas flux proxies
- heat flow (mW/m²), geothermal gradient (°C/km)
- gravity anomalies (mGal) and time-variable mass change

All variables are **externally measured** with published methods and uncertainties.

---

## Reproducibility and Validation

- continuous instrumental monitoring (global networks)
- independent catalog cross-validation (multiple agencies)
- multi-method agreement (GNSS ↔ InSAR ↔ seismic ↔ gravity)
- published uncertainty bounds and revision history
- long-baseline consistency (decades) plus geological proxies (much longer)

---

## Falsifiability Statement

This LDSF classification **must be revised or rejected** if:

- plate motion is not reproducible across independent geodetic networks,
- seismic catalogs cannot be independently verified and reconciled within uncertainty,
- volcanic activity cannot be externally measured and replicated across observational systems,
- or global geological dynamics collapse into isolated, non-shared LD-only events with no persistent field structure.

No reinterpretation is permitted.

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors geologic systems as a **shared planetary field (LDSF1)**
- ✔ documents coupling across domains (LDSF2) using **measured datasets**
- ✔ remains strictly empirical and audit-ready

This file does **not**:
- ✖ imply planetary agency
- ✖ assert symbolic meaning
- ✖ introduce metaphysical claims
