# ICHTHYOLOGY — LDF Empirical Proof Dataset

## Purpose
This document catalogs **international, peer-reviewed, empirically grounded datasets** that **demonstrate** (not merely assert) that **Ichthyology** satisfies the criteria for classification as a **Light-Dimension Field (LDF1–LDF4)** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

Only **measured variables**, **validated methodologies**, and **institutionally persistent datasets** are included.  
No interpretive theory, cognition claims, or symbolic assertions are introduced.

---

## 1. Proof Standard (LDF Qualification Gate)

Ichthyology qualifies as **LDF** if and only if **all** of the following are empirically satisfied:

1. **Externally measurable variables** exist with units and protocols.  
2. **Population- and assemblage-level structure** persists beyond individuals.  
3. **Independent replication** occurs across institutions and regions.  
4. **Statistical regularities** remain stable across time (within uncertainty).  
5. **Explicit falsifiers** can be stated and tested.

Failure of any criterion downgrades classification to LD-only.

---

## 2. Core Empirical Domains (Independent Proof Axes)

Ichthyology is supported as LDF by **multiple independent empirical axes**, each sufficient to demonstrate shared field structure.

---

## 3. Population Structure & Abundance (Field-Level Persistence)

### 3.1 Long-Term Fisheries-Independent Surveys
**Data classes:**
- NOAA NMFS bottom trawl surveys (Atlantic, Pacific)
- ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS)
- DFO Canada multispecies surveys

**Measured variables:**
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Density | individuals·km⁻² |
| Biomass | kg·km⁻² |
| Size-frequency | length bins |
| Species composition | relative abundance |

**Proof anchor:**  
Population and assemblage structure persists across **decades**, **vessels**, and **sampling crews**, demonstrating observer-independent field structure.

---

## 4. Growth & Life-History Scaling (Replicated Biological Regularities)

### 4.1 Age–Length Relationships
**Method:** Otolith microstructure analysis  
**Global replication:** Thousands of species across marine and freshwater systems

**Model form (empirically fit):**
$$
L(t) = L_\infty (1 - e^{-k(t-t_0)})
$$

**Proof anchor:**  
Species-specific growth parameters replicate across laboratories and regions with predictable environmental modulation.

---

### 4.2 Length–Weight Allometry
**Measured across:** FAO species catalogs, FishBase, national stock assessments

$$
W = aL^b
$$

**Proof anchor:**  
Exponent $b$ consistently clusters near ~3 with species-specific deviation, demonstrating **shared biological scaling** rather than individual variance.

---

## 5. Mortality & Turnover (Population Kinetics)

### 5.1 Catch Curve Analyses
**Datasets:**
- ICES stock assessments
- NOAA stock synthesis models

**Measured variables:**
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Total mortality (Z) | yr⁻¹ |
| Natural mortality (M) | yr⁻¹ |
| Fishing mortality (F) | yr⁻¹ |

$$
Z = M + F
$$

**Proof anchor:**  
Mortality rates derived independently from age structure converge across methods, supporting population-level kinetic fields.

---

## 6. Movement & Migration (Spatial Field Coupling)

### 6.1 Telemetry & Tagging Networks
**Global programs:**
- Ocean Tracking Network (OTN)
- ATLAS acoustic arrays
- NOAA and ICES tagging programs

**Measured variables:**
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Migration timing | day-of-year |
| Movement distance | km |
| Habitat residency | proportion of time |

**Proof anchor:**  
Consistent migratory corridors and timing windows recur across cohorts and years, demonstrating **shared spatial-temporal structure**.

---

## 7. Assemblage Structure (Community-Level Regularities)

### 7.1 Reef, Pelagic, and Demersal Assemblages
**Data sources:**
- Reef Life Survey
- Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network
- Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) programs

**Measured variables:**
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Species richness | count |
| Evenness | index |
| Trophic composition | proportion |

**Proof anchor:**  
Assemblage structure shows reproducible statistical patterns tied to habitat and productivity gradients, not individual fish behavior.

---

## 8. Ecosystem Coupling & Biogeochemical Flux

### 8.1 Fish-Mediated Nutrient Cycling
**Measured in:**
- Lake ecosystems
- Coral reefs
- Open ocean systems

**Variables:**
| Flux | Units |
|---|---|
| Nitrogen excretion | g N·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |
| Phosphorus flux | g P·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |
| Carbon transfer | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |

**Proof anchor:**  
Fish-driven nutrient fluxes measurably alter primary productivity and ecosystem function, confirming LDF-scale coupling.

---

## 9. Cross-Institutional Replication (Non-Negotiable Proof)

Ichthyology LDF claims are supported by **convergent evidence** from:
- Government agencies (NOAA, ICES, DFO)
- International consortia (FAO, OTN)
- Academic long-term ecological research programs

Agreement across **methods**, **regions**, and **institutions** establishes robustness.

---

## 10. Falsifiability Conditions (Explicit)

Ichthyology-as-LDF must be **rejected or downgraded** if:

1. Population structure fails replication across independent surveys.  
2. Growth or mortality parameters lose convergence under reanalysis.  
3. Migration patterns collapse into non-repeatable noise.  
4. Assemblage structure becomes observer-dependent.  
5. Fish-mediated fluxes cannot be distinguished from background variability.

---

## 11. Canonical Species & Stock Anchors (Empirical)

| Domain | Species / Unit | Evidence Type |
|---|---|---|
| Anadromous | *Oncorhynchus mykiss* | tagging, stock assessment |
| Demersal | *Gadus morhua* | multi-decade surveys |
| Pelagic | *Thunnus albacares* | telemetry, fisheries |
| Freshwater | *Esox lucius* | growth & population |
| Reef | *Acanthurus triostegus* | assemblage surveys |

These are **anchors**, not exhaustive lists.

---

## 12. Legacy Mapping (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)

Earlier UCC/UDC corpora referencing **LD6–LD9 (aquatic life fields)** map directly to:
**LDF1–LDF4** under current UCC standards.

All future ichthyology proofs must satisfy LDF-tier criteria defined here.
