# GALACTIC ECOSYSTEMS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document catalogs **peer-reviewed, observational, and laboratory-validated datasets** supporting the classification of **galactic ecosystems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no new theory**
- applies **no symbolic interpretation**
- references **only externally measurable, falsifiable data**

All cited phenomena are:
- shared across observers,
- stable across independent instruments,
- and constrained by known physical laws.

---

## LDSF1 — Foundational Shared Galactic Field

Galactic systems qualify as **LDSF1** by satisfying the minimal LDSF condition:

> **Externally measurable, population-level structure and dynamics that persist independently of any single component.**

### LDSF1 Evidence Classes

| Property | Empirical Basis |
|--------|----------------|
| Persistent structure | Galaxy morphology & kinematics |
| Shared dynamics | Rotation curves, orbital coupling |
| Population continuity | Stellar populations across epochs |
| External measurability | Multi-wavelength astronomy |

---

## LDSF2 — Emergent Galactic Ecosystem Coupling

At larger scales, galaxies exhibit **ecosystem-like coupling** through:

- mergers and tidal interactions
- chemical enrichment feedback
- star-formation regulation
- heavy-element redistribution

These qualify as **LDSF2** phenomena: shared-field interactions across multiple LDSF1 entities.

---

## Primary Measured Domains

| Domain | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Galactic Structure | Spiral, elliptical, irregular morphology |
| Stellar Populations | Age, mass, metallicity distributions |
| Merger Dynamics | Interacting and coalescing galaxies |
| Chemical Enrichment | Metallicity gradients and yields |
| Feedback Processes | Star formation & gas regulation |

---

## Galactic Structure Measurements

### Representative Observables

| Parameter | Typical Range | Measurement Method |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Total mass | 10⁹–10¹² M☉ | Rotation curves, lensing |
| Disk scale length | 1–10 kpc | Photometry |
| Rotation velocity | 50–300 km/s | Doppler spectroscopy |
| Halo extent | >100 kpc | Stellar tracers, lensing |

**Data Sources**
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
- Gaia Mission (ESA)
- Hubble Space Telescope archives

---

## Galaxy Merger Dynamics

### Quantified Indicators

| Indicator | Observed Range |
|---------|----------------|
| Merger timescale | 10⁸–10⁹ years |
| Star formation enhancement | 2–10× baseline |
| Gas inflow rates | 1–100 M☉/yr |
| Shock velocities | 100–1000 km/s |

Measured via:
- H I and CO line mapping (ALMA, VLA)
- infrared starburst surveys
- numerical orbital reconstruction validated against observation

---

## Heavy-Element (Metal) Production

### Verified Astrophysical Pathways

| Process | Empirically Verified Products |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Stellar fusion | C, N, O, Ne |
| Core-collapse supernovae | Elements up to Fe |
| Type Ia supernovae | Fe-peak elements |
| Neutron-star mergers | r-process elements (Au, Pt, U) |

---

## Laboratory and Nuclear Physics Validation

Astrophysical yields are constrained by **laboratory physics**, including:

- measured nuclear cross-sections
- isotope decay chains
- accelerator experiments
- meteoritic isotope ratios

These impose **quantitative bounds** on galactic chemical models.

---

## Galactic Metallicity Distributions

### Observed Patterns

| Region | Metallicity (Z / Z☉) |
|------|----------------------|
| Galactic centers | 1–3 |
| Disk mid-radius | 0.5–1 |
| Outer halo | <0.1 |
| Dwarf galaxies | 0.01–0.3 |

Measured via:
- emission and absorption spectroscopy
- stellar population synthesis
- quasar absorption line systems

---

## Dual Delay-Field Evidence (τ)

Two independently measured delay fields coexist:

1. **Gravitational delay**
   - orbital decay
   - dynamical friction
   - merger timescales

2. **Chemical delay**
   - nucleosynthesis timescales
   - metal mixing and dispersal
   - star-formation feedback lag

These delays are **quantified separately** and show **statistical coupling** during galactic evolution.

---

## Authoritative Data Sources

### Observational Archives
- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
- Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
- James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
- ALMA Molecular Gas Surveys
- ESA Gaia Mission

### Peer-Reviewed Literature
- *The Astrophysical Journal*
- *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*
- *Astronomy & Astrophysics*
- *Nature Astronomy*

---

## Reproducibility and Validation

- multi-survey convergence
- multi-wavelength confirmation
- isotopic and spectral consistency
- published uncertainty bounds
- independent instrument agreement

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for galactic ecosystems **must be revised or rejected** if:

- galaxy merger rates lose observational support,
- heavy-element synthesis pathways are experimentally invalidated,
- or metallicity gradients fail independent replication.

No reinterpretation or symbolic adjustment is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ establishes galactic ecosystems as **shared physical fields**
- ✔ supports LDSF1 → LDSF2 progression
- ✔ remains strictly empirical

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ imply agency
- ✖ introduce metaphysics
