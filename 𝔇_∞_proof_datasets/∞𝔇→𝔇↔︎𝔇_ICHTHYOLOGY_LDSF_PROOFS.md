# Ichthyology — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document provides **quantitative, peer-reviewed, internationally replicated empirical evidence** supporting the classification of **ichthyology (fish systems)** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

The structure strictly follows:

**Shared-field claim → externally measurable variables → authoritative datasets → falsifiability conditions**

No interpretation, symbolic inference, or framework-specific assumptions are introduced.

---

## Shared-Field Claim Being Tested

> **Claim:**  
> Fish populations constitute observer-independent, externally measurable shared biological fields characterized by population-level dynamics, temporal structure, and environmental coupling that persist beyond individual organisms.

---

## Core Empirical Validation Matrix

| Shared-Field Feature | Measurable Variable | Typical Quantitative Range* | Primary Data Source | Measurement Method |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Population abundance | Individuals · km⁻² | 10² – 10⁶ | NOAA / ICES surveys | Trawl, acoustic, visual census |
| Biomass | Metric tons or kg · km⁻² | 10¹ – 10⁷ | RAM Legacy Database | Stock assessment models |
| Recruitment | Age-0 / juvenile counts | 10⁴ – 10⁹ cohort⁻¹ | ICES / NOAA indices | Cohort reconstruction |
| Mortality (M, F) | Annual rate (yr⁻¹) | 0.05 – 1.5 | FAO / ICES reports | Catch-at-age models |
| Growth | von Bertalanffy parameters | L∞: 10–300 cm; k: 0.05–1.2 | FishBase | Length-at-age fitting |
| Environmental coupling | Temp–biomass slope | ~1–3% Δ biomass · °C⁻¹ | NOAA ecosystem reports | Time-series regression |

\*Ranges reflect published assessments; values vary by species, region, and ecosystem.

## Authoritative International Datasets

### 1. RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database
- >2,500 assessed fish stocks worldwide  
- Biomass (B), fishing mortality (F), recruitment (R) time series  
- Multi-decadal coverage with uncertainty estimates  
- Used by FAO, ICES, NOAA, CSIRO, DFO Canada  

### 2. ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea)
- North Atlantic and adjacent seas  
- Spawning stock biomass (SSB), recruitment indices  
- Temperature-productivity coupling analyses  
- Fully peer-reviewed advisory process  

### 3. NOAA Fisheries Survey Programs
- Standardized bottom-trawl surveys (since 1960s)  
- Acoustic biomass estimation  
- Length, age, abundance distributions  
- Independent audit and replication  

### 4. FAO Global Fisheries & Aquaculture Statistics
- Capture and aquaculture production (metric tons)  
- Country, regional, and global aggregation  
- Annual temporal resolution  

### 5. FishBase
- >35,000 fish species  
- Growth, maturity, fecundity, longevity parameters  
- Derived exclusively from peer-reviewed literature  

---

## Observer Independence & Replication

Evidence meets LDSF criteria because:

- Population metrics are reproduced by **independent institutions**
- Survey protocols are **standardized and documented**
- Uncertainty is explicitly reported (CI, posterior distributions)
- Time-series persist across decades and political boundaries

No variable depends on a single observer, laboratory, or model.

---

## Minimum Variable Set for Falsification

A valid LDSF classification requires that all of the following remain independently measurable:

### Spatial
- geographic distribution
- habitat-specific abundance

### Temporal (τ)
- recruitment periodicity
- cohort persistence
- stock rebuilding timescales

### Aggregate (Σ)
- biomass
- spawning stock biomass
- population-level mortality

### Memory / Persistence (μ)
- multi-decadal stock trajectories
- legacy effects of exploitation and recovery

---

## Falsifiability Conditions (Strict)

The LDSF classification for ichthyology **must be revised or rejected** if:

1. Fish population abundance cannot be independently estimated.
2. Biomass and recruitment series fail cross-institutional replication.
3. Environmental drivers (temperature, oxygen, productivity) show no measurable coupling to population dynamics.
4. Population-level metrics collapse into non-comparable, individual-only observations.

No reinterpretation after failure is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses numeric, externally verifiable data only  
- ✔ remains framework-agnostic and discipline-portable  
- ✔ supports LD → LDSF coupling via population-level observables  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ infer cognition or consciousness  
- ✖ assign ethical, symbolic, or teleological meaning  
- ✖ extrapolate beyond measured domains
