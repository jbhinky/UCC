# ICHTHYOLOGY — LD Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **peer-reviewed empirical datasets, long-running observational programs, and institutional measurement archives** that support the LD1–LD4 parameter regimes referenced in:

→ `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱_ichthyology_ld.md`

This file:
- introduces **no interpretation**
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **externally verifiable empirical anchors only**

All datasets listed are suitable for **independent stress testing and replication**.

---

## LD1 — Molecular and Cellular Fish Biophysics

### Supported Phenomena
- Osmoregulation at the cellular level  
- Metabolic rate scaling  
- Sensory transduction in aquatic environments  

### Empirical Data Sources
- Ion transport and gill epithelium studies
- Cellular respiration measurements
- Hormonal stress signaling assays

### Representative Measured Variables

| Variable | Units | Measurement Context |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity | μmol·mg⁻¹·h⁻¹ | Gill epithelium assays |
| Cellular oxygen consumption | μmol O₂·g⁻¹·h⁻¹ | Respirometry |
| Cortisol concentration | ng·mL⁻¹ | Blood plasma assays |

---

## LD2 — Integrated Physiology and Functional Systems

### Supported Phenomena
- Aquatic respiration
- Locomotor energetics
- Thermal and salinity tolerance

### Empirical Data Sources
- Gill ventilation and oxygen extraction studies
- Swim tunnel respirometry
- Critical thermal tolerance experiments

### Representative Measured Variables

| Variable | Units | Measurement Context |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Oxygen extraction efficiency | % | Respirometry |
| Cost of transport | J·kg⁻¹·m⁻¹ | Swim tunnel tests |
| Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) | °C | Thermal ramp assays |
| Salinity tolerance range | PSU | Osmoregulation trials |

---

## LD3 — Behavior, Learning, and Ecological Interaction

### Supported Phenomena
- Schooling and coordination
- Habitat selection
- Migration behavior

### Empirical Data Sources
- Acoustic and satellite telemetry
- Behavioral conditioning experiments
- Habitat utilization surveys

### Representative Measured Variables

| Variable | Units | Measurement Context |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| School density | individuals·m⁻³ | Field observation |
| Migration distance | km | Tagging / telemetry |
| Habitat occupancy probability | proportion | Survey analysis |
| Conditioning success | % | Behavioral assays |

---

## LD4 — Life History, Migration Persistence, and Population Dynamics

### Supported Phenomena
- Reproduction and recruitment
- Anadromy, catadromy, diadromy
- Long-term population persistence

### Empirical Data Sources
- Stock assessment programs
- Larval recruitment surveys
- Longitudinal population monitoring

**Eels** are treated here under **catadromous and diadromous life histories** within ichthyology.

### Representative Measured Variables

| Variable | Units | Measurement Context |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Fecundity | eggs·female⁻¹ | Reproductive surveys |
| Recruitment index | index value | Larval surveys |
| Age-structured abundance | individuals | Stock assessments |
| Population growth rate (r) | dimensionless | Census modeling |
| Genetic diversity index | dimensionless | Population genomics |

---

## Data Integrity and Audit Notes

- All datasets listed are **externally generated**
- No simulated-only data is used without observational grounding
- Measurement uncertainty is explicitly reported by source institutions
- Datasets are suitable for **re-analysis and falsification**

---

## Falsifiability Statement

If future empirical results:
- contradict measured parameter ranges, or
- invalidate data collection methodologies,

then the associated Applied LD mappings **must be revised or removed**.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ provides empirical anchors only
- ✔ supports independent replication
- ✔ preserves LD-only classification

This document does **not**:
- ✖ infer selfhood or cognition
- ✖ assert identity continuity
- ✖ justify theoretical frameworks
