# PSYCHOLOGY — LDF Empirical Proof Dataset

## Purpose
This document provides **tier-1, peer-reviewable empirical anchors** supporting the classification of **Psychology** as a **Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** under UCC.

Only the following are permitted:
- **externally measurable variables** (units + protocols),
- **replicated effects** across labs/cohorts/nations,
- **institutionally maintained datasets** (public or governed access),
- **quantified uncertainty**,
- **explicit falsifiers**.

No metaphysics, symbolism-as-causation, or narrative claims.

---

## 0) LDF Proof Standard (Non-Negotiable)
Psychology qualifies as **LDF** at a given tier if—and only if—ALL conditions hold:

1. **Measurement:** variables have units + standardized procedures.  
2. **Replication:** effects repeat across independent labs/cohorts.  
3. **Field structure:** statistical regularities persist across time/space (not identical; *stable within uncertainty*).  
4. **Uncertainty:** error bars / confidence intervals / credible intervals are reported or derivable.  
5. **Falsifiers:** clear conditions exist that would downgrade or invalidate the tier.

If any condition fails, classification must be downgraded (to LD-only, or to a lower LDF tier).

---

## 1) What “Psychology-as-LDF” Means Here (Operational)
> **Applied LDF claim (operational):**  
> Psychology constitutes an LDF when **measurable behavioral and cognitive structure** (accuracy, latency, error distributions, learning curves, psychometric reliability, population prevalence) exhibits **replicable statistical regularities** across individuals and contexts, and these regularities are maintained in institutional datasets.

This is *not* a claim about meaning, selfhood, or qualia. It is a claim about **measured coordination in behavior/decision/time** that persists beyond any single individual.

---

## 2) Tiering Constraint: LDF1–LDF4 Only
### 2.1 LDF tiers (operational)
- **LDF1:** Individual-level task structure that replicates across labs (reaction time distributions, psychometric reliability, basic learning curves).
- **LDF2:** Group / cohort structure (age bands, clinical vs control contrasts, cross-lab cohort replication).
- **LDF3:** Population structure (national / multi-national surveys; stable prevalence + covariate structure; large cohort studies).
- **LDF4:** System coupling (measurable linkage between behavior/cognition and **external** system variables such as education outcomes, injury risk, accident rates, workforce participation, hospitalization burden—*only where the linkage is measured and replicated*).

### 2.2 Legacy alignment (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)
- **LD6 ≈ LDF1:** replicated individual task structure  
- **LD7 ≈ LDF2:** cohort / subgroup structure  
- **LD8 ≈ LDF3:** population-scale psychological field structure  
- **LD9 ≈ LDF4:** measurable coupling into large systems (health/education/economy/ecology)  

No higher claims are made here.

---

## 3) Core Measurable Indicators (Psychology LDF)
All indicators below are **externally measurable**, repeatable, and dataset-anchorable.

| Indicator family | Variable examples | Units / outputs |
|---|---|---|
| Performance accuracy | % correct, d′, error rate | %, signal-detection units |
| Decision latency | reaction time (RT), response time distributions | ms |
| Learning dynamics | slope of improvement, forgetting rate | Δperformance / time |
| Timing / temporal judgment | temporal order thresholds, binding windows | ms |
| Reliability | test-retest ICC, Cronbach α | 0–1 |
| Population prevalence | prevalence, incidence | %; cases / N |
| Risk / impairment | crash rate, injury rate, hospitalization | events / exposure |

---

## 4) Dataset Infrastructure Anchors (Institutional / International)
These infrastructures demonstrate psychology is not “stories,” but **measurement systems**.

### 4.1 Population surveys (substance + mental health + behavior)
- **NSDUH (SAMHSA, U.S.)**: large-scale, recurring population survey with **public-use files and codebooks**, covering substance use and behavioral health indicators.  [oai_citation:0‡SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Monitoring the Future (U. Michigan ISR)**: long-running national survey series with published statistical structure over decades (youth + adults).  [oai_citation:1‡Monitoring the Future](https://monitoringthefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtf2023.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

> These provide **LDF3 anchors**: stable prevalence distributions + trend uncertainty + cross-year comparability under institutional maintenance.

### 4.2 Neurobehavioral open science repositories (task + brain data)
- **OpenNeuro**: repository class enabling standardized sharing of neuroimaging/neurophysiology datasets linked to tasks and metadata (supports cross-lab replication workflows).  [oai_citation:2‡SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**: large cohort neuroimaging + behavioral measures with documented access and governance (supports multi-site reproducibility).  [oai_citation:3‡NDA](https://nda.nih.gov/study.html?id=1944&utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

> These provide **LDF2–LDF3 anchors**: task + measurement pipelines enabling replication and meta-analysis.

---

## 5) Temporal Processing Anchor (LDSF1 within Psychology LDF)
You requested Libet-class timing as an LDSF1 anchor, framed strictly as **temporal processing structure**.

### 5.1 What is empirically anchored here (no metaphysical claims)
- **Readiness potential / action timing paradigms** and **intentional binding** paradigms operationalize measurable timing relationships between:
  - motor preparation signals,
  - action execution timestamps,
  - perceived timing reports,
  - perceived action-effect interval compression.

A peer-reviewed synthesis explicitly relates Libet-type designs and intentional binding as measurable timing structure in voluntary action paradigms.  [oai_citation:4‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4051209/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 5.2 Minimal LDSF1 claim allowed here
> **LDSF1 (temporal-processing) claim:**  
> Human timing reports and action-effect perception show **systematic, replicable temporal structure** (e.g., binding/interval compression) that is measurable as latency shifts and distribution changes under controlled task conditions.

This supports psychology-as-LDF because it is **quantified timing structure** (not meaning).

---

## 6) Substance Use: LD vs LDF (Operational, Stress-Testable)
You asked to show substance abuses as **LD and LDF collapses** of lower layers—without drifting into unmeasurable narrative.

### 6.1 Definitions (strictly operational)
- **LD (acute state, LD1–LD2 compatible):** short-window measurable impairment in an individual (minutes–days), e.g., RT slowing, increased error rate, disrupted sleep architecture, impaired inhibitory control.
- **LDF disruption (population / cohort field):** stable, measurable shifts in distributions across cohorts or populations (months–years), e.g., prevalence structure, relapse rates, hospitalization burden, crash statistics.

### 6.2 Measurable “collapse” markers (allowed)
These are **quantified degradations** in stability/predictability—not metaphysical collapse:

| Collapse marker | Measurement | Typical direction under misuse |
|---|---|---|
| Reaction time stability | RT variance, tail heaviness | increases |
| Inhibitory control | stop-signal RT, commission errors | worsens |
| Working memory | span, n-back accuracy | decreases |
| Sleep / circadian stability | sleep duration variance, timing drift | increases |
| Recovery / rest ability | return-to-baseline time constant | slows |
| Reward-driven habit dominance | reinforcement learning parameters; relapse rates | shifts toward habitual responding |

### 6.3 Dataset anchors for substance-linked field structure
- **NSDUH** provides recurring, nationally comparable distributions for use patterns and many behavioral health measures, enabling stress tests on prevalence and subgroup structure.  [oai_citation:5‡SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Monitoring the Future** provides decades-scale prevalence and trend structure, enabling cross-year replication of field-level shifts.  [oai_citation:6‡Monitoring the Future](https://monitoringthefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mtf2023.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

> These anchor **LDF3**: population-scale structure that can be falsified by replication failure or breakdown of methodological comparability.

### 6.4 Falsifiable statement (substance as LD/LDF disruption)
Psychology-as-LDF claims about substance-linked disruption **fail** if:
1) acute impairment metrics do not replicate under controlled designs, **or**  
2) population distributions do not replicate across time under institutional survey standards, **or**  
3) purported effects are not distinguishable from sampling / instrumentation noise once uncertainty is applied.

---

## 7) Mathematical Forms Permitted (Data-fit only; no theory-as-proof)
### 7.1 Drift / recovery time constant (restoration dynamics)
Used when longitudinal data exist (individual or cohort):
$$
x(t) = x_{base} + (x_0 - x_{base}) e^{-t/\tau_r}
$$
Where $x(t)$ is a measured variable (e.g., RT, sleep duration), and $\tau_r$ is estimated with uncertainty from data.

### 7.2 Error/latency distribution shift (field structure)
When comparing cohorts:
$$
\Delta \mu = \mu_{groupA} - \mu_{groupB}, \quad
\Delta \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_{groupA} - \sigma^2_{groupB}
$$
All differences require confidence intervals / bootstrap / Bayesian posterior intervals.

### 7.3 Reliability gate (measurement integrity)
Test–retest reliability as a minimal field-stability requirement:
$$
ICC \in [0,1]
$$
Low ICC undermines LDF claims at that measurement layer.

---

## 8) Stress-Test Checklist (Peer-Review Defense)
Every psychological LDF claim must pass:

| Audit step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 1 | Variable defined with units (or explicit psychometric scale) |
| 2 | Protocol described (task or survey instrument) |
| 3 | Dataset named (institutional archive / DOI / governed access) |
| 4 | Replication path stated (independent cohort/lab or repeated waves) |
| 5 | Uncertainty stated (CI/SE/credible interval) |
| 6 | Falsifier stated (what outcome forces downgrade) |

---

## 9) Falsifiability Triggers (Downgrade Rules)
Psychology-as-LDF must be revised/downgraded if:
1) core task effects fail multi-lab replication under comparable protocols,  
2) institutional surveys lose comparability or their distributions become non-replicable under the same sampling standards,  [oai_citation:7‡SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
3) timing/binding effects cannot be reproduced under controlled conditions with defined measurement windows,  [oai_citation:8‡PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4051209/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
4) uncertainty bounds swamp the claimed field structure (no detectable effect beyond noise).
