# ENTOMOLOGY — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally generated empirical datasets** that substantiate classifying **entomological systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF1–LDSF2)** in **UCC v2.5.1**.

Constraints:
- **No interpretation**
- **No new theory**
- **No symbolic inference**
- **No model preference**
- **Datasets and peer-reviewed data products only**

All listed sources are **auditable**, **replicable**, and **measured externally**.

---

## LDSF Scope (Operational)

### LDSF1 — Shared Population Field
Externally measurable insect dynamics aggregated at **population/community** scales:
- occurrence and abundance patterns
- phenology and life-stage timing
- population regulation, outbreaks, and recovery
- spatial distribution and range shifts

### LDSF2 — Shared Interaction / Coordination Field
Externally measurable insect-mediated coupling to **other shared systems**:
- pollination networks and plant reproduction coupling
- vector-borne transmission systems
- social insect coordination outputs (nest activity, foraging flux, colony productivity)
- trophic interaction structure (predation / parasitism / mutualism)

**Note:** LDSF2 does **not** require claims about insect internal states. It only requires **externally measurable, cross-observer, system-level coupling**.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated (Index Form)

> **Claim (Indexable):**  
> Insect systems exhibit **shared, externally measurable field behavior** across time (τ), symbol-like external markers (Σ, e.g., classification/identity labels and measurable signals), and memory-like persistence in measurable state variables (μ, e.g., continuity of population structure and interaction networks), expressed as population- and interaction-level regularities that are reproducible across observers.

This file validates the claim only by **pointing to datasets that contain the relevant measurable variables**.

## Validation Mapping (Claim → Variable → Dataset)

| LDSF Tier | UCC Aspect | Observable Variable (Examples) | Dataset Class | External Measurement Mode | Replication Evidence Type |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|

| LDSF1 | Developmental timing (τ) | stage durations, degree-day timing, emergence dates | phenology/development | lab & field measurements, phenology networks | cross-species replication |
| LDSF1 | Population regulation | outbreak thresholds, cyclicity, mortality | long-term population surveys | trapping networks, standardized counts | multi-year continuity |
| LDSF2 | Pollination coupling | visitation rate, pollen transport proxies, yield-linked visitation | pollination/agroecology | standardized transects, farm surveys, ecology studies | cross-region comparability |

## Primary Empirical Source Classes (Recommended Minimum Set)

| Dataset / Repository | Institution / Steward | Contains Variables | Notes (Data Type Only) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) | GBIF network | georeferenced occurrences; time series; sampling metadata | multi-source aggregation |
| iNaturalist Research-Grade (via aggregators) | iNaturalist / partners | timestamped georeferenced occurrences | observation-driven (requires QC filtering) |
| National / regional insect atlases | multiple | occurrence & range maps | jurisdiction-specific standards |
| Long-term trapping networks (light-trap / suction trap) | institutional networks | standardized abundance indices | long time horizon where available |

**Representative measured variables (LDSF1):**

---

## Minimum “Peer Review Pressure-Test” Requirements (Audit Checklist)

A dataset/source qualifies for this index if it satisfies **all**:
1. **Externally measured variables** (instrumental/observational protocols described)
2. **Replicability pathway** (repeated across time, sites, or institutions)
3. **Auditable metadata** (sampling method, date, location, uncertainty if available)
4. **Independent observers possible** (not private/irreproducible one-off measurement)

---

## Validation Status (General)

- Longitudinal insect monitoring exists across multiple regions and taxa
- Multi-institution biodiversity aggregation exists (occurrence + time)
- Repeated phenology/development measurements exist across environments
- Interaction datasets exist for pollination networks and vector ecology

This section asserts only that these **dataset classes exist** and are widely used in entomology/ecology/public health workflows.

---

## Falsifiability Statement (Operational)

The LDSF classification for entomology must be revised/rejected if any of the following become true under audit:

1. **Population-scale insect variables cannot be independently measured** (occurrence/abundance/phenology not observable outside individuals)
2. **Developmental timing (τ) fails cross-environment replication** beyond stated uncertainty bounds
3. **Coupling fields (pollination/vector/social outputs) cannot be measured externally** or cannot be reproduced across independent studies
4. The best available evidence shows insect system dynamics reduce entirely to **isolated, non-shared LD-only processes** with no population- or interaction-level regularities measurable across observers

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted to preserve dataset integrity.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ indexes entomology as a **shared biological field** (LDSF1) and **shared coupling field** (LDSF2)
- ✔ maps claims to measurable variables and dataset classes
- ✔ remains empirical and auditable

This file does **not**:
- ✖ claim insect consciousness, agency, or intention
- ✖ claim symbolic reasoning
- ✖ claim moral status
- ✖ introduce metaphysical statements
