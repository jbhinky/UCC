# Institutional Structures — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document provides **externally verifiable, peer-reviewed, and internationally replicated empirical evidence** supporting the classification of **institutional structures** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

It is structured as:

**shared-field claim → measurable institutional variables → authoritative datasets → falsifiability criteria**

No interpretation, valuation, or normative judgment is introduced.

---

## Shared-Field Claim Being Tested

> **Claim:**  
> Institutional systems constitute shared, observer-independent social fields characterized by persistence, scale, temporal structure, and reproducible coordination patterns that exist beyond individual participants.

---

## Core Empirical Validation Matrix

| Shared-Field Feature | Measurable Variable | Typical Quantitative Range* | Authoritative Dataset | Measurement Method |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Institutional persistence | lifespan of institutions | 10¹–10²+ years | Polity Project, historical registries | archival reconstruction |
| Governance structure | regime indices | −10 to +10 (Polity scale) | Polity V Dataset | comparative coding |
| Legal production | statutes enacted · yr⁻¹ | 10²–10⁴ | national legal gazettes | legislative counts |
| Economic coordination | GDP, public expenditure | 10⁸–10¹⁴ USD | World Bank, IMF | national accounts |
| Organizational density | institutions · capita⁻¹ | 10⁻⁴–10⁻² | OECD datasets | registry analysis |
| Policy response lag (τ) | event → policy interval | months–years | OECD Gov. Indicators | event-response analysis |

\*Ranges reflect cross-national datasets and vary by era, system type, and state capacity.

## Primary International Data Sources

### 1. Polity V Project
- Political regime characteristics (1800–present)
- Standardized institutional structure metrics
- Widely used in comparative political science and history

### 2. World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)
- Government effectiveness
- Regulatory quality
- Rule of law
- Control of corruption
- Annual cross-national coverage with uncertainty bounds

### 3. OECD Institutional & Public Governance Databases
- Public administration structures
- Policy implementation timelines
- Organizational form and reform tracking

### 4. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
- Institutional budget flows
- Cross-national fiscal comparability

### 5. National Legal & Constitutional Archives
- Legislative records
- Constitutional texts
- Formal institutional charters
- Archival continuity across decades to centuries

---

## Observer Independence & Replication

Evidence qualifies as LDSF because:

- Data are produced by **independent international institutions**
- Measurement protocols are **documented and audited**
- Variables replicate across **countries, cultures, and eras**
- Uncertainty and coding limitations are explicitly reported

Institutional patterns persist even as individual participants change.

---

## Minimum Variable Set for Falsification

A valid LDSF classification requires that all of the following remain independently measurable:

### Structural (Σ)
- number and type of institutions
- organizational hierarchies
- jurisdictional scope

### Temporal (τ)
- institutional lifespan
- policy response delays
- reform and replacement cycles

### Aggregate Coordination
- budget flows
- legal output rates
- governance effectiveness indices

### Persistence / Memory (μ)
- institutional survival across generations
- continuity of rules, offices, and procedures

---

## Falsifiability Conditions (Strict)

The LDSF classification for institutional structures **must be revised or rejected** if:

1. institutions cannot be externally documented or measured,
2. structural persistence fails beyond individual tenure,
3. large-scale coordination cannot be quantified,
4. or institutional patterns reduce entirely to individual-level behavior.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ grounds LDSF classification in real institutional data
- ✔ is compatible across political, economic, and legal systems
- ✔ supports LD → LDSF coupling via population-scale coordination

This document does **not**:
- ✖ assign legitimacy or moral value
- ✖ infer collective intentionality or consciousness
- ✖ prescribe ethical or political outcomes

## Primary External Sources

- Polity V Project  
- World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators  
- OECD Institutional & Public Governance Statistics  
- International Monetary Fund Government Finance Statistics  
- National legislative and constitutional archives
