# ENTOMOLOGY — Metamorphics LD Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **peer-reviewable empirical datasets and institutional repositories**
that support the metamorphic (developmental transformation) regimes referenced in:

→ `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱_entomology_ld_metamorphics.md`

This file:
- contains **no interpretation**
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **traceable empirical anchors only**

All sources are selected to be:
- independently verifiable,
- suitable for replication or re-analysis,
- stable enough for citation in scientific review.

## LD1 — Molecular & Hormonal Control of Metamorphosis (Cell-Level)

### What is empirically anchored
- Steroid hormone signaling pathways (ecdysteroids)
- Receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation (e.g., EcR/USP complex in model systems)
- Juvenile hormone regulation of developmental timing
- Stage-specific gene induction and repression

### Data repositories and programs (primary anchors)
- **FlyBase** (curated genetics + developmental expression evidence for *Drosophila melanogaster*; metamorphosis-related gene reports and supporting references)
- **NCBI Gene / RefSeq / GenBank** (sequence records and gene-centered evidence linking to primary literature)
- **Protein Data Bank (PDB)** (structures of receptors, ligands, and relevant molecular complexes where available)
- **PubMed / PubMed Central** (peer-reviewed primary literature supporting molecular regulators)

### Representative measurable variables
| Variable | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hormone concentration (ecdysteroids) | ng·mL⁻¹ / ng·g⁻¹ | Stage-dependent |
| Receptor expression by stage | counts / TPM / RPKM | Platform-dependent |
| Binding affinity (where measured) | Kd (M) | Ligand–receptor assays |
| Gene induction/repression timing | hours / stage windows | Developmental time-course |

---

## LD2 — Tissue Reorganization During Metamorphosis (Organ-Level)

### What is empirically anchored
- Histolysis (larval tissue breakdown)
- Imaginal disc growth and differentiation (holometabola)
- Tissue-specific remodeling (muscle, gut, trachea, nervous system)
- Endocrine control of timing and progression

### Data repositories and programs (primary anchors)
- **modENCODE / modERN developmental resources (Drosophila)** (transcriptomic and regulatory datasets across developmental stages)
- **FlyBase integrations of modENCODE datasets** (curated or distilled access paths used widely by Drosophila researchers)
- **NCBI GEO / SRA** (raw and processed expression datasets supporting developmental-stage transitions)
- **InsectBase 2.0** (multi-species insect genomes + transcriptomes that can include developmental-stage expression resources)

### Representative measurable variables
| Variable | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tissue-specific expression shift | TPM / counts | Stage and tissue dependent |
| Morphometric change | mm / μm / % | Imaging-dependent |
| Time to pupation / eclosion | hours / days | Species-dependent |
| Differentiation marker presence | binary / score | Assay-dependent |

## LD3 — Behavioral and Ecological Correlates of Metamorphic Life Cycles

### What is empirically anchored
- Stage-specific behavior differences (larval feeding vs adult dispersal)
- Stage-specific habitat usage and phenology
- Navigation and dispersal measurements (especially adult stage)
- Phenotypic timing under environmental inputs (temperature, photoperiod)

### Data repositories and programs (primary anchors)
- **Long-term ecological monitoring datasets** (life stage timing and abundance; depends on region/program)
- **Taxon-specific community databases** for insects (genomes and metadata supporting ecological + phenotypic comparisons)
- **i5k Workspace@NAL** (community-curated arthropod genome resources; useful for linking genotype ↔ phenotype work)
- **Peer-reviewed behavioral ecology datasets** deposited to recognized repositories (Dryad, institutional archives, journal supplements)

### Representative measurable variables
| Variable | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Larval growth rate | mass·time⁻¹ / length·time⁻¹ | Controlled or field |
| Pupal duration | hours / days | Environment-dependent |
| Adult dispersal distance | m / km | Tracking method dependent |
| Phenology timing | day-of-year | Long-term monitoring |

## LD4 — Metamorphosis as a Persistence Process (Lifecycle + Population)

### What is empirically anchored
- Complete (holometabolous) vs incomplete (hemimetabolous) metamorphosis schedules
- Survival rates through life stages (egg/larva/pupa/adult)
- Recruitment variability
- Population persistence across generations under environmental variation

### Data repositories and programs (primary anchors)
- **Taxon-curated lifecycle datasets** (often in peer-reviewed ecology and entomology literature with archived supporting tables)
- **Global insect gene resources** (InsectBase 2.0; i5k Workspace) enabling cross-species life history comparisons
- **Long-term monitoring programs** where publicly archived (region- and taxon-specific; use only those with institutional hosting)

### Representative measurable variables
| Variable | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stage survival probability | proportion | Stage-specific |
| Fecundity | eggs·female⁻¹ | Species-dependent |
| Generation time | days / weeks | Environment-dependent |
| Population growth rate (r or λ) | dimensionless | Model + census |

## Data Integrity and Audit Notes

- Only **institutional** and/or **peer-reviewed** sources are included.
- Use **raw repositories (GEO/SRA)** when possible for reproducible re-analysis.
- If a source is a **curation layer** (e.g., FlyBase), it must map back to primary datasets and literature.
- Conflicting datasets must be logged as conflicts; do not merge without explicit method documentation.

---

## Falsifiability Statement

If future experiments:
- overturn the measured hormonal regulators,
- invalidate a referenced dataset,
- or demonstrate systematic measurement error,

then the related metamorphics mappings must be **revised or removed**.
No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ provides empirical anchors only  
- ✔ supports replication and audit  
- ✔ preserves LD-only classification  

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer selfhood or consciousness  
- ✖ assert identity continuity across metamorphosis  
- ✖ justify theoretical frameworks
