# CEPHALOPODS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally produced, peer-reviewed, and observational datasets** that empirically support the classification of **cephalopods** (e.g., squid, octopus, cuttlefish) as participating in a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **no interpretation**
- catalogs **independent, auditable empirical anchors only**

All sources listed are **externally generated**, **replicable**, and **observable without reference to internal subjective states**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

In legacy UCC versions (≤ 2.5.0), advanced animal coordination systems were often grouped under **LD6–LD7**.

As of **UCC v2.5.1**, cephalopod shared coordination is classified as **LDSF1**, with:
- **LD** describing physical substrates (sensory organs, chromatophores, neural tissue),
- **LD5** acting as the union operator, and
- **LDSF** describing **externally observable, population-level coordination fields**.

---

## LDSF1 — Cephalopod Shared Coordination Fields

Cephalopods qualify for LDSF1 classification through **externally measurable, shared biological coordination mechanisms**, including:

- rapid visual signaling via chromatophores
- spatial coordination during hunting and defense
- habitat-level population structure and migration
- seasonal and cyclic reproductive timing

These phenomena occur **across individuals** and are **measurable at group or population scales**.

---

## Primary Empirical Domains and Anchors

### A. Visual Signaling and Chromatophore Coordination

| Dataset / Study Class | Institution / Journal | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Chromatophore activation studies | Journal of Experimental Biology | pattern frequency, activation latency |
| Skin reflectance & pattern dynamics | Proceedings of the Royal Society B | spatial propagation, contrast ratios |
| Camouflage matching experiments | Marine Biology | background matching accuracy |

**Representative measured quantities:**
- chromatophore expansion rate (ms)
- spatial propagation velocity of patterns
- spectral reflectance (nm)
- contrast and edge-detection metrics

---

### B. Collective and Group Behavior

| Dataset / Study Class | Institution / Journal | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Group hunting observations | Marine Ecology Progress Series | inter-individual spacing, coordination timing |
| Schooling and aggregation surveys | ICES / NOAA Fisheries | density, group size distributions |
| Predator–prey interaction studies | Proceedings of the Royal Society B | attack synchronization, success rates |

**Representative measured quantities:**
- nearest-neighbor distance (m)
- coordination onset timing (s)
- group size distributions
- encounter rates

---

### C. Habitat Use and Population Structure

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Cephalopod stock assessments | ICES | biomass estimates, age structure |
| Regional cephalopod surveys | NOAA Fisheries | spatial distribution, abundance |
| Tagging and tracking datasets | Research consortia | movement paths, depth profiles |

**Representative measured quantities:**
- population density (individuals km⁻²)
- migration distance (km)
- depth range (m)
- seasonal abundance indices

---

### D. Reproductive Timing and Cycles

| Dataset / Study Class | Institution / Journal | Measured Variables |
|---|---|---|
| Seasonal spawning records | ICES / regional fisheries bodies | spawning period length |
| Life-history trait databases | Marine Biology journals | age at maturity, fecundity |
| Environmental coupling studies | Journal of Molluscan Studies | temperature/photoperiod thresholds |

**Representative measured quantities:**
- spawning onset date
- reproductive cycle length
- egg mass counts
- temperature/photoperiod correlations

---

## Quantitative Anchor Table (Non-Interpretive)

| LDSF Claim (Cephalopods) | Measured Quantity | Units / Form | Example Anchor Sources |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visual signaling propagates across individuals | pattern propagation speed | cm·s⁻¹ | J. Exp. Biol.; Proc. R. Soc. B |
| Group coordination is measurable | inter-individual spacing | m | Marine Ecology Prog. Ser. |
| Population structure is externally observable | biomass indices | tonnes; index values | ICES; NOAA Fisheries |
| Reproductive cycles are shared and periodic | spawning timing | days; months | ICES; Marine Biology |

---

## Validation Status

- replicated across multiple species and regions
- laboratory and field agreement documented
- quantitative variables reported with uncertainty where applicable
- independent institutional data sources (fisheries, academic journals)

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for cephalopods must be revised if:
- collective signaling cannot be externally measured,
- population-level coordination fails replication,
- or cephalopod dynamics reduce to isolated, non-shared LD-only processes.

No reinterpretation of datasets is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors cephalopod behavior as a **shared biological coordination field**
- ✔ supports independent audit and replication
- ✔ remains ethically constrained under Shepherd

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ infer subjective experience
- ✖ introduce symbolic or metaphysical claims
