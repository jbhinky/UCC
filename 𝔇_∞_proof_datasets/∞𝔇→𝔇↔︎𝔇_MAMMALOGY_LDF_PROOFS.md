# MAMMALOGY — LDF Empirical Proof Dataset

## Reader Orientation (Required)
This document demonstrates—using **only empirical, externally measurable evidence**—that **mammalian systems form a Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** attribute cognition, intent, or meaning to mammals,
- does **not** rely on symbolic or phenomenological interpretation,
- does **not** propose new biological theory.

It **does** establish that mammalian systems exhibit **shared, observer-independent statistical structure** that persists across space and time and therefore qualify as an **LDF**.

---

## 1. Proof Standard (Non-Negotiable)

Mammalogy qualifies as an **LDF** if—and only if—the following conditions are satisfied:

1) Variables are **externally measurable** with units and standardized protocols  
2) Measurements **replicate across institutions, regions, and taxa**  
3) Statistical regularities persist across **spatial and temporal scales**  
4) Uncertainty is **quantified and reported**  
5) Explicit **falsification conditions** exist  

Failure of any condition invalidates LDF classification at that tier.

---

## 2. Definition of Mammalogy-as-LDF (Operational)

> **Operational Definition:**  
> Mammalogy constitutes a Light-Dimension Field when mammalian populations collectively exhibit **stable statistical regularities** in morphology, physiology, demography, movement, interaction, and ecosystem flux that:
> - cannot be reduced to single individuals,
> - persist across regions and time,
> - remain measurable independent of observer identity.

---

## 3. Empirical Domains Supporting Mammalogy-as-LDF

### 3.1 Morphology & Structural Scaling (LDF1)

**Measured Variables**
- body mass
- limb length
- cranial dimensions
- surface area

**Empirical Anchors**
- museum skeletal collections
- comparative morphometric databases
- digitized 3D morphology archives

**Field Property**
Allometric relationships remain consistent across mammalian orders.

**Representative Form**
$$
Y = Y_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

---

### 3.2 Physiology & Energetics (LDF1–LDF2)

**Measured Variables**
- basal metabolic rate (BMR)
- field metabolic rate (FMR)
- thermoregulatory range
- reproductive energetic cost

**Measurement Methods**
- respirometry
- doubly-labeled water
- bio-telemetry

**Empirical Result**
Metabolic scaling exponents converge across taxa and environments.

$$
BMR = B_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

---

### 3.3 Life History Structure (LDF2)

**Measured Variables**
- age at maturity
- gestation length
- litter size
- interbirth interval
- longevity

**Datasets**
- long-term field demography
- wildlife management records
- comparative life-history databases (e.g., PanTHERIA, AnAge)

**Field Property**
Reproducible trade-offs exist between growth, survival, and reproduction.

---

### 3.4 Population Dynamics (LDF2–LDF3)

**Measured Variables**
- abundance
- density
- survival probability
- recruitment rate

**Measurement Methods**
- mark–recapture
- distance sampling
- camera-trap networks
- acoustic surveys (marine mammals)

**Canonical Model**
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

**Field Property**
Population-level coherence persists despite individual stochasticity.

---

### 3.5 Spatial Structure & Movement Ecology (LDF3)

**Measured Variables**
- home range size
- dispersal distance
- migration timing
- movement velocity

**Measurement Methods**
- GPS collars
- satellite telemetry
- Movebank global tracking infrastructure
- passive acoustic arrays (cetaceans)

**Empirical Regularity**
Movement metrics scale predictably with body mass and habitat structure.

$$
HR \propto M^{\beta}
$$

---

### 3.6 Interaction Effects (LDF3)

**Measured Variables**
- predation rate
- herbivory pressure
- competition indices
- social group size

**Measurement Methods**
- kill-site analysis
- exclusion experiments
- long-term behavioral monitoring

**Field Property**
Interactions produce repeatable, measurable impacts beyond individuals.

---

### 3.7 Ecosystem Coupling (LDF4 Gate)

**Measured Variables**
- secondary production
- vegetation removal
- nutrient redistribution via movement
- trophic cascade strength

**Measurement Methods**
- biomass accounting
- isotope tracing
- long-term exclusion and rewilding experiments

**Validation**
Mammalian populations measurably alter ecosystem-level fluxes.

---

## 4. Dataset Infrastructure (International Anchors)

Empirical support derives from **independent global infrastructures**, including:

- PanTHERIA (mammal traits)
- AnAge (longevity and life history)
- EltonTraits (diet and foraging)
- Movebank (movement ecology)
- GBIF (occurrence data; filtered)
- IUCN spatial datasets
- NEON mammal monitoring
- Long-term terrestrial and marine observatories

Each empirical claim must be traceable to **≥2 independent data classes**.

---

## 5. Taxonomic Breadth (Order-Level Coverage)

LDF regularities are observed across:
- Carnivora
- Artiodactyla
- Perissodactyla
- Rodentia
- Primates
- Chiroptera
- Proboscidea
- Cetacea

This breadth confirms **field-level coherence**, not lineage-specific effects.

---

## 6. Species-Level Proof Anchors (Representative)

| Domain | Species | Evidence Type |
|---|---|---|
| Carnivore | *Canis lupus* | telemetry, demography |
| Herbivore | *Loxodonta africana* | movement, vegetation impact |
| Marine mammal | *Balaenoptera musculus* | acoustics, energetics |
| Rodent | *Microtus pennsylvanicus* | population cycles |
| Primate | *Pan troglodytes* | long-term field datasets |

---

## 7. Reproducibility Evidence

| Test | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Cross-site trait scaling | replicated |
| Metabolic exponents | convergent |
| Movement–body size coupling | stable |
| Population models | predictive within uncertainty |
| Ecosystem effects | directionally consistent |

---

## 8. Falsifiability Conditions

Mammalogy fails LDF classification if:

1) scaling laws collapse under expanded datasets  
2) demographic regularities fail replication  
3) movement metrics lose cross-site coherence  
4) ecosystem impacts cannot be independently measured  

---

## 9. Legacy Alignment (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)

| Legacy Layer | LDF Mapping | Description |
|---|---|---|
| LD6 | LDF1 | individual morphology & physiology |
| LD7 | LDF2 | population structure |
| LD8 | LDF3 | regional movement & interaction fields |
| LD9 | LDF4 | biosphere-scale ecosystem coupling |

Mapping is **structural**, not interpretive.
