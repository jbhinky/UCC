# EDUCATION SYSTEMS — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally produced, peer-reviewed, and institutionally audited datasets** that support classification of **education systems as a Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- contains **no interpretation**
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **empirical anchors only**

Education is treated here as a **shared, population-level coordination system** observable through externally measured learning trajectories, instructional timing, and longitudinal outcomes.

---

## Dataset Inclusion Rules (Anti-Distortion Constraint)

Only datasets meeting all conditions below are listed:

1. Produced or curated by recognized academic, governmental, or international institutions  
2. Variables defined with explicit measurement procedures  
3. Longitudinal or cross-cohort structure enabling external verification  
4. Replicable access (public reports, archives, or documented request pathways)  
5. Uncertainty, error, or sampling limitations documented by the source

**Exclusion rule:** Anecdotal, purely qualitative, or single-cohort classroom studies without replication infrastructure are not included.

---

## LDSF Mapping Clarification (Alignment Note)

Education systems qualify as LDSF because their core observables are:

- **shared across populations** (cohorts, nations, systems),
- **measured externally** (assessments, progression metrics),
- **time-structured** (instructional delay, spacing, sequencing),
- **independent of individual internal awareness**.

This file does **not** claim that learning *requires* LDSF to occur—only that education systems *operate as* a shared field at scale.

---

## A. Core Observable Variable Families

| Variable Family | Examples | Measurement Form |
|---|---|---|
| Learning retention | delayed recall, spacing intervals | score deltas over time |
| Achievement | standardized assessment performance | scaled scores, percentiles |
| Progression | grade advancement, completion rates | cohort survival curves |
| Exposure | instructional hours, curriculum sequencing | duration, ordering |
| Equity | variance across groups or regions | distributions, gaps |
| System performance | national or regional outcomes | aggregated indices |

---

## B. Primary Empirical Dataset Inventory

### B1 — Learning Delay & Cognitive Timing (Foundational)

| Source | Institution | Anchored Phenomenon |
|---|---|---|
| Ebbinghaus forgetting data (historical baseline) | Leipzig tradition | memory decay over time |
| Cepeda et al. meta-analyses | APA / Psychological Science | spacing and retention effects |
| Bjork & Bjork | Psychological Review | retrieval difficulty vs. durability |
| Dunlosky et al. | PSPI | effectiveness of learning strategies |

**Note:** These are included strictly as **replicated empirical timing effects**, not as theory claims.

---

### B2 — Large-Scale Student Assessment Systems

| Dataset | Provider | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **PISA** | OECD | cross-national achievement (15-year-olds) |
| **TIMSS / PIRLS** | IEA | mathematics, science, reading |
| **NAEP** | NCES (USA) | national longitudinal assessment |
| **National Pupil Database** | UK DfE | cohort-level outcomes |

These datasets provide **population-level observables** suitable for LDSF anchoring.

---

### B3 — System-Level Education Infrastructure & Outcomes

| Dataset / Portal | Institution | What It Anchors |
|---|---|---|
| UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) | UNESCO | enrollment, attainment, completion |
| World Bank Education Data | World Bank | system investment vs. outcomes |
| Institute of Education Sciences (IES) | US Dept. of Education | program evaluation, longitudinal panels |
| RAND Education | RAND Corporation | policy-linked outcome studies |

---

## C. Minimal LDSF Proof Index (Non-Interpretive)

| LDSF Claim | Empirical Anchor |
|---|---|
| Learning outcomes vary with instructional timing | spacing / delay datasets |
| Education operates across cohorts | longitudinal assessments |
| Outcomes are externally measurable | standardized testing |
| System-level patterns persist beyond individuals | national & cross-national datasets |
| Educational change propagates through populations | cohort and policy-linked shifts |

---

## Validation Status

- Replication across decades
- Cross-national convergence on core metrics
- Meta-analytic confirmation of delay effects
- Transparent documentation of uncertainty

---

## Falsifiability Statement

This LDSF classification must be revised if:

- population-level education outcomes cannot be externally measured,
- delayed learning effects fail large-scale replication,
- or education systems reduce entirely to isolated, non-shareable processes.

No reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors education as a **shared, time-structured system**
- ✔ supports audit and replication
- ✔ remains ethically constrained under Shepherd

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ infer intent or moral agency
- ✖ replace pedagogy with ideology
