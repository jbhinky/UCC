# BIOLOGY — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document indexes **externally produced, peer-reviewed, and observational datasets** that empirically ground the classification of **biology as a Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** in **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- contains **no interpretation**
- introduces **no new theory**
- provides **traceable empirical anchors only**

All sources listed are **independently generated**, **replicable**, and **auditable**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

In legacy UCC versions (≤ 2.5.0), population-scale biological phenomena were referenced under **LD6 (shared field map)**.

As of **UCC 2.5.1**, population-scale biology is classified as **LDSF1**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator** between:
- **LD** (structural / biophysical substrate), and
- **LDSF** (shared biological fields observable across many organisms simultaneously).

## LDSF1 — Population-Level Biological Coordination

### Dataset Classes

| Domain | Description | Measurement Scale |
|---|---|---|
| Population dynamics | Birth, death, migration, age structure | Local → Global |
| Reproductive timing | Seasonal and cyclical reproduction | Annual / Multi-year |
| Selection pressure | Fitness differentials across environments | Generational |
| Epidemiology | Pathogen transmission networks | Regional → Global |
| Collective behavior | Group movement and coordination | Local → Regional |

---

## Primary Empirical Sources

### 1. Population Biology & Demography

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) | Max Planck Institute | Population size (N), growth rate (r), variability |
| Living Planet Index | WWF / ZSL | Species abundance indices over time |
| Human Mortality Database | Max Planck / UC Berkeley | Mortality rates, survivorship, life expectancy |

---

### 2. Evolutionary Biology & Genetics (Aggregated Scope)

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| GenBank (aggregated analyses) | NCBI | Allele presence and frequency (population-level) |
| 1000 Genomes Project | International Consortium | Human genetic variation frequencies |
| Tree of Life Web Project | Multi-institutional | Phylogenetic branching relationships |

**Scope clarification:**  
Genetic sequence databases are referenced **only insofar as they are aggregated across populations and time**. Individual molecular sequences are not treated as LDSF entities. Population-level allele frequency change, phylogenetic branching, and evolutionary turnover constitute the shared-field biological phenomena indexed here.

---

### 3. Epidemiology & Shared Health Fields

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| WHO Global Health Observatory | World Health Organization | Incidence, prevalence, mortality |
| CDC WONDER | Centers for Disease Control | Morbidity, mortality, outbreak statistics |
| GISAID | International Consortium | Viral genomic variation across populations |

---

### 4. Ecology & Species Interaction

| Dataset | Institution | Measured Quantities |
|---|---|---|
| GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) | GBIF | Species occurrence and co-occurrence |
| Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network | NSF | Long-term ecosystem metrics |
| TRY Plant Trait Database | Global Consortium | Functional trait distributions |

---

## Measured Variables (Representative)

- Population size (N)
- Growth rate (r)
- Birth and death rates
- Migration distance and frequency
- Allele frequency (population-scale)
- Infection rate (R₀)
- Species richness
- Trophic interaction strength

All variables are **externally measured** and **independent of internal experience**.

---

## Quantitative Anchor Table (Non-Interpretive)

| Biological LDSF Claim | Measured Quantity | Units / Form | Dataset Anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Population coordination exists | Population size (N) | count / density | GPDD; Living Planet Index |
| Shared temporal regulation | Birth and death rates | events·time⁻¹ | Human Mortality Database |
| Selection acts at population scale | Allele frequency change | proportion / generation | GenBank (aggregated); 1000 Genomes |
| Disease propagates through shared fields | R₀, incidence rate | dimensionless; cases·time⁻¹ | WHO GHO; CDC WONDER |
| Ecosystem interactions are shared | Species co-occurrence | probability / frequency | GBIF; LTER |

---

## Validation Status

- Cross-validated across independent institutions
- Longitudinal datasets spanning decades
- Statistical methodologies documented by source providers
- Measurement uncertainty explicitly reported

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for biology must be revised if:

- population-level biological dynamics cannot be empirically observed,
- shared biological coordination fails replication,
- or population-scale biological coordination is shown to require **internal subjective awareness** rather than **externally measurable interaction networks**.

No reinterpretation of results is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors biology as a **shared external field**
- ✔ supports reproducibility and audit
- ✔ remains ethically constrained under Shepherd

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ infer agency
- ✖ merge interpretation with data
