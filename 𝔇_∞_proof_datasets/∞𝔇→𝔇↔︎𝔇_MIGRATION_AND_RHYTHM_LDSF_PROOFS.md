# Migration and Rhythm — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document provides **publish-ready empirical anchors** for classifying **migration and rhythmic systems** as a **shared, externally measurable field (LDSF)** by mapping:

**Claim → measurable variables → international datasets → measurement methods → falsifiability**

This file contains **measured-domain criteria only**:
- No symbolic inference.
- No teleology.
- No consciousness claims.
- No framework-specific assumptions required for validity.

---

## LDSF Claim Being Validated (Empirical / Agnostic)

> **Claim:**  
> Migration and biological rhythmic systems constitute **observer-independent shared fields**: measurable, reproducible patterns in timing, phase, periodicity, route structure, and population synchrony that persist beyond individuals and can be independently verified across observers, instruments, and institutions.

---

## Minimal Variable Set Required for LDSF Classification

The following variables are sufficient to test “shared field” status with strict falsifiability:

### A) Rhythm variables (Chronobiology)
- period (hours for circadian; days for infradian; ~annual for circannual)
- phase (clock time of peak activity / physiology; e.g., onset times)
- amplitude (activity counts, hormone concentrations, expression counts)
- entrainment sensitivity (phase response to light/temp/food/season cues)
- free-running deviation under constant conditions (no Zeitgeber)

### B) Migration variables (Movement ecology)
- individual tracks (lat/long/time series; speed; heading)
- route geometry (corridors, stopover clusters, tortuosity)
- timing metrics (departure date, arrival date, stopover duration)
- distance metrics (total path length; straight-line displacement)
- population synchrony (variance across individuals; cohort-level phase locking)

### C) Environmental coupling (shared external constraints)
- photoperiod (day length), irradiance, temperature, precipitation
- geomagnetic indices or field model parameters (where relevant)
- resource proxies (chlorophyll-a for marine, NDVI for terrestrial)
- ocean currents / winds (vectors; seasonality)

### D) Institutional replication requirements
- independent observers/instruments can re-measure the same variables
- protocols publish metadata (sampling intervals, sensor type, error bounds)
- uncertainty is quantifiable (GPS error, Argos class error, detection bias)

## Core Empirical Domains

| Domain | Externally Measured Phenomena | Typical Time Scales (τ) |
|---|---|---|
| Circadian biology | period, phase, entrainment, PRC shifts | hours → days |
| Circannual biology | seasonal timing of reproduction/molt/migration | months → years |
| Migration (terrestrial) | routes, stopovers, corridor stability | days → months |
| Migration (marine) | long-distance seasonal tracks | weeks → months |
| Synchrony | population-level timing coherence | days → years |
| Planetary timing anchors | day, year, lunar/tidal cycles | hours → years |

---

## Quantitative Rhythm Parameters (Measured Ranges)

### 1) Circadian timing (humans and animals)
Representative measured ranges (species-dependent; lab protocols vary):

| Parameter | Representative Range | Measurement Context |
|---|---:|---|
| circadian period (entrained) | ~24 h | field/lab under stable light-dark cycles |
| free-running period (constant conditions) | ~23.5–24.7 h | constant dim light / constant darkness; species dependent |
| daily phase variability within individuals | minutes → ~1 h | depends on cue stability and measurement type |
| phase shift response to light (acute) | ~0.5–2 h per session | bright light exposure; protocol dependent |
| phase response curve (PRC) peak shift windows | early night delay / late night advance | classic PRC structure across taxa |

**Operational τ anchors (explicit examples):**
- A 60–120 minute bright-light exposure can measurably shift circadian phase the same day or next day (lab protocols).
- Seasonal entrainment shifts (circannual) occur over **weeks to months**, measurable as changes in migration onset, breeding onset, or molt timing.

### 2) Lunar/tidal rhythmicity (where applicable)
| Cycle | Period | Where It Appears |
|---|---:|---|
| semidiurnal tide | ~12.4 h | coastal activity/spawning cues in some taxa |
| synodic month | ~29.53 d | synchronized spawning in some marine organisms |
| seasonal cycle | ~365.2422 d | circannual timing across many migratory species |

---

## Migration Metrics (Representative Quantitative Examples)

These are widely documented, **species- and region-dependent**, provided as stress-test anchors:

### Avian migration (examples)
| Species / Case | Distance | Time | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Arctic tern (annual round-trip) | ~70,000–90,000 km | ~annual | multi-leg polar-to-polar routes |
| bar-tailed godwit (long non-stop leg) | ~10,000–11,000 km | ~8–10 days | sustained flight; route-specific |

### Terrestrial mammal migration (examples)
| Species / System | Distance | Cycle | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| wildebeest (Serengeti–Mara system) | ~800–1,500 km | annual | rainfall/forage-driven loops |
| caribou (some herds) | ~500–1,200 km | annual | calving and wintering grounds |

### Marine migration (examples)
| Species / Case | Distance | Cycle | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| gray whale | ~15,000–16,000 km | annual | feeding↔breeding grounds |
| humpback whale (varies) | thousands of km | annual | basin-specific migrations |

### Insect migration (examples)
| Species / Case | Distance | Time | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| monarch butterfly (some populations) | ~3,000–4,500 km | seasonal | multi-generational migration |

These values are not “proof by example”; they are **sanity bounds** used to validate that datasets contain the required movement and timing resolution.

---

## International Dataset Index (Primary LDSF Anchors)

### 1) Global occurrence & distribution infrastructure (broad, multi-taxa)
- **GBIF** — occurrence records for migratory taxa (presence, time, location).
- **OBIS** — marine species occurrences (including migratory marine species).

**What they provide (measurable variables):**
- occurrence lat/long, time stamps, observation/collection basis
- range shifts over decades (diachronic occurrence analysis)
- cross-institution replication (many contributing nodes)

---

### 2) High-resolution movement tracking (individual trajectories)
- **Movebank** — animal tracking repository (GPS, Argos, biologgers) across taxa.
- **ARGOS** satellite telemetry datasets (where shared via projects/repositories).
- **Ocean Tracking Network (OTN)** — acoustic telemetry and movement detections (marine).
- **IMOS** (Australia) and other national ocean observing systems (regional but rigorous).

**What they provide:**
- track time series (location/time), sampling rate (seconds → hours), sensor metadata
- error models (GPS error, Argos location class uncertainty)
- stopover detection, corridor mapping, speed/heading distributions

---

### 3) Migration monitoring at population scale (birds especially; but extensible)
- **eBird** — large-scale citizen-science observations with validation workflows.
- **European bird portals / national atlases** (regionally standardized monitoring).
- **BTO** and national ringing/banding programs (mark–recapture, recoveries).

**What they provide:**
- phenology curves (first arrival, peak passage windows, departure timing)
- abundance indices across weeks/months (seasonal migration waves)
- long-term trend series enabling decade-scale replication tests

---

### 4) Chronobiology and rhythmic physiology (lab + field)
Sources vary by species, but the measurable category is stable:

- controlled circadian studies (actigraphy, wheel-running, melatonin/cortisol timing)
- field chronobiology (light loggers, temperature loggers, timing of activity onset)
- genomic/proteomic timing where available (time-series expression)

**What they provide:**
- period estimates under entrained and free-running conditions
- phase response measurements (light pulses; feeding schedules)
- rhythm amplitude and stability metrics across cohorts

---

### 5) Environmental “Zeitgeber” datasets (external entrainment fields)
These are critical because they are **non-biological external constraints**:

- **Photoperiod / solar geometry**: computed from location/date (astronomical rules).
- **Climate time series**: temperature, precipitation, winds (national + global reanalysis).
- **Oceanography**: SST, currents, chlorophyll-a (satellite + buoy networks).
- **Geomagnetic field models / indices**: external orientation constraints where tested.
- **Tide predictions / observed tides**: coastal timing anchors.

**What they provide:**
- independent drivers to test coupling: “migration timing vs. photoperiod/temperature/current”
- external replication: any lab can pull the same environmental time series

---

## Empirical Validation Table (Claim → Variable → Dataset → Method → Replication)

| LDSF Feature | Measurable Variable | Dataset Class (International) | Measurement Method | Replication & Audit Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rhythm period stability | circadian period (h) | chronobiology labs + field loggers | actigraphy, activity counts, hormone timing | multi-cohort replication; protocol metadata |
| Entrainment sensitivity | phase shift magnitude (min–h) | controlled exposure experiments | light pulse protocols; PRC mapping | reproducible dose/timing response |
| Migration geometry | corridor width, stopover clusters | Movebank / telemetry repos | GPS/Argos; clustering (DBSCAN/HDBSCAN) | independent track reprocessing |
| Migration timing | departure/arrival distributions | eBird / national monitoring / telemetry | phenology curves; arrival timing | cross-year consistency; sampling bias models |
| Population synchrony | cohort variance in timing | tracking + monitoring combos | circular statistics; synchrony indices | independent cohorts; cross-site |
| Environmental coupling | timing vs photoperiod/temp/currents | climate/ocean reanalysis + tracks | regression, GAMs, state-space models | held-out years; sensitivity analyses |

---

## Reproducibility & Bias Controls (Publish-Ready Requirements)

To keep this “peer-stress-testable,” the following controls should be included (or explicitly marked absent) in any analysis using these datasets:

1. **Sampling interval declared** (e.g., 5 min GPS vs 6 h Argos).
2. **Location error model stated** (GPS error, Argos class).
3. **Detection bias handled** for citizen-science datasets (effort covariates, occupancy models).
4. **Season definitions standardized** (calendar vs phenological season).
5. **Time zone normalization** (UTC vs local solar time; daylight savings handling).
6. **Cohort definitions explicit** (age class, sex, population, tagging year).
7. **Cross-validation** across years and/or regions (no single-year claims).

---

## Falsifiability Statement (Non-Negotiable)

This LDSF classification must be revised or rejected if **any** of the following holds:

1. **Rhythms cannot be externally measured** with reproducible period/phase estimates across independent labs or field observers.
2. **Migration timing fails replication** across cohorts/years once measurement error and sampling bias are accounted for.
3. **Population synchrony is not measurable** (i.e., variance does not converge under improved sampling, or is observer-defined only).
4. Apparent shared patterns collapse into **non-comparable individual narratives** without stable population-level statistics.
5. External entrainment variables (photoperiod/temperature/tides/currents) show **no measurable coupling** where coupling is predicted by the measured-domain claim.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ provides externally measurable criteria only
- ✔ supports LD → LDSF coupling via shared-field evidence (timing + synchrony + environmental constraints)
- ✔ remains framework-agnostic and portable

This file does **not**:
- ✖ assign meaning, purpose, or ethical status
- ✖ claim cognition or consciousness
- ✖ require symbolic mapping to remain valid

---

## External Peer-Reviewed Sources (Representative Categories)

- chronobiology: circadian entrainment, phase response, hormone timing, actigraphy
- movement ecology: telemetry methods, state-space models, stopover/corridor inference
- macroecology: phenology shifts, population synchrony, climate coupling
- ocean/atmosphere science: reanalysis, currents, SST, winds, tide observations

(These categories are intentionally listed without “single-paper dependence.”)
