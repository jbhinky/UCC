# GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document catalogs **quantitative, peer-reviewed, and instrument-validated datasets** supporting the classification of **geochemical cycles** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file:
- introduces **no theory**
- performs **no symbolic interpretation**
- references **only externally measurable, falsifiable data**

All cited processes are:
- shared across observers,
- persistent across time,
- and constrained by laboratory-verified physical chemistry.

---

## LDSF1 — Foundational Shared Planetary Field

Geochemical cycles qualify as **LDSF1** by satisfying the minimal LDSF criterion:

> **Externally measurable, persistent fluxes between planetary reservoirs that exist independently of individual organisms.**

### LDSF1 Evidence Classes

| Property | Empirical Basis |
|--------|----------------|
| Persistent reservoirs | Atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere |
| Measurable flux | Element transfer rates |
| Temporal continuity | Decadal → geological timescales |
| External observability | Instrumental & geochemical records |

---

## LDSF2 — Coupled Earth-System Dynamics

At larger scales, geochemical cycles participate in **LDSF2 coupling** through:

- atmosphere–ocean exchange
- lithosphere–biosphere interaction
- climate–chemistry feedback
- long-term sequestration and release

These couplings link multiple LDSF1 reservoirs into a **shared planetary system**.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated

> **Claim:**  
> Elemental cycles constitute shared planetary fields characterized by persistent, measurable fluxes between Earth-system reservoirs, independent of any individual organism or local process.

---

## Empirical Validation Table

| UCC Aspect | Observable Variable | Dataset / Institution | Measurement Method | Replication |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Carbon cycling | Atmospheric CO₂ (ppm) | NOAA ESRL | Global monitoring stations | Continuous since 1958 |
| Ocean uptake | Dissolved inorganic carbon | WOCE / NOAA | Ship-based sampling | Multi-basin |
| Nitrogen cycling | N₂O, nitrate flux | IPCC / FAO | Field + satellite | Global |
| Phosphorus reservoirs | Soil & sediment P | USGS | Geochemical surveys | Cross-regional |
| Sulfur cycling | SO₂ column density | NASA Aura / OMI | Satellite spectroscopy | Global |
| Long-term storage | Carbonate burial rates | IODP | Marine core analysis | Geological |

All variables are **externally measurable**, **population-scale**, and **observer-independent**.

## Cycle-Specific Evidence

### 1. Carbon Cycle (τ)

**Measured Variables**
- atmospheric CO₂ concentration
- oceanic carbon inventories
- terrestrial biomass carbon

**Primary Sources**
- NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory  
- Global Carbon Project  
- IPCC AR6 Working Group I  

**LDSF Basis**
- fluxes are global
- persist without biological mediation
- measurable across decades to millions of years

---

### 2. Nitrogen Cycle

**Measured Variables**
- nitrate and ammonium concentrations
- biological and abiotic fixation rates
- atmospheric N₂O levels

**Primary Sources**
- FAO Global Nitrogen Assessments  
- IPCC AR6  
- National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

---

### 3. Phosphorus and Sulfur Cycles

**Measured Variables**
- mineral weathering rates
- sedimentary phosphorus pools
- volcanic and anthropogenic sulfur emissions

**Primary Sources**
- US Geological Survey (USGS)  
- NASA Aura / OMI  
- Peer-reviewed geochemistry literature

---

## Laboratory and Chemical Validation

Elemental cycling is constrained by:
- thermodynamics
- reaction kinetics
- isotope fractionation
- experimentally measured solubility and decay constants

Laboratory chemistry provides **upper and lower bounds** on all planetary flux estimates.

---

## Temporal Delay Structure (τ)

Two independently measured delay regimes exist:

1. **Fast cycles**
   - atmospheric mixing
   - ocean surface exchange
   - seasonal turnover

2. **Slow cycles**
   - sediment burial
   - lithification
   - tectonic recycling

Both delays are **quantified**, **independent**, and **non-symbolic**.

---

## Reproducibility and Validation

- multi-decadal instrumental records
- cross-reservoir mass balance agreement
- independent institutional verification
- published uncertainty and error bounds
- laboratory–field consistency

---

## Falsifiability Statement

The LDSF classification for geochemical cycles **must be revised or rejected** if:

- global elemental fluxes cannot be measured independently,
- reservoir continuity fails across time,
- or cycling reduces entirely to isolated LD-only reactions.

No reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ establishes geochemical cycles as **shared planetary fields**
- ✔ supports LD → LDSF1 → LDSF2 progression
- ✔ remains strictly empirical

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer biological purpose
- ✖ assert Gaia-style agency
- ✖ introduce symbolic or ethical meaning
