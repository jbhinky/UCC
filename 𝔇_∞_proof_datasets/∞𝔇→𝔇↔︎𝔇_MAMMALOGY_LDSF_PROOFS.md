# Mammalogy — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose

This document provides **internationally verifiable, peer-reviewed empirical evidence** supporting the classification of **mammalian systems** as a **shared, externally measurable field** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

Structure is strictly:

**UCC claim → measurable variables → authoritative datasets → falsifiability conditions**

No symbolic, ethical, metaphysical, or consciousness-based interpretation is introduced.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated

> **Claim:**  
> Mammalian systems exhibit shared, observer-independent biological regularities expressed through population-level structure, conserved life-history scaling, physiological constraints, and spatial–temporal organization that persist beyond individual organisms.

---

## Core Empirical Validation Table

| Shared-Field Feature | Measurable Variable | Observed Quantitative Range | Authoritative Dataset | Measurement Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Life-history scaling | Gestation length | ~15–660 days | PanTHERIA | Comparative trait synthesis |
| Growth & size | Adult body mass | ~2 g – 150,000 kg | PanTHERIA / AnAge | Field & museum records |
| Longevity | Maximum lifespan | ~1–200+ years | AnAge | Verified demographic records |
| Metabolic constraint | Basal metabolic rate | ~M⁰·⁷⁵ scaling | Comparative physiology literature | Respirometry |
| Population structure | Density (ind/km²) | <0.01 – >10,000 | IUCN / NEON | Standardized census |
| Spatial persistence | Range extent | km² → continental | IUCN Red List spatial data | GIS synthesis |
| Reproductive timing | Inter-birth interval | months–decades | PanTHERIA | Longitudinal observation |

Ranges reflect documented mammalian diversity across taxa and ecosystems.

## Authoritative International Data Sources

### 1. PanTHERIA Database  
(*Jones et al., Ecology*)

- Life-history, ecological, and geographic traits for ~5,400 mammal species  
- Standardized variables across body size, reproduction, and ecology  
- Widely used in macroecology and comparative biology

### 2. AnAge Database  
(*Tacutu et al., Nucleic Acids Research*)

- Longevity, aging, and mortality records  
- Curated from peer-reviewed demographic studies  
- Explicit uncertainty tracking

### 3. IUCN Red List (Mammals)

- Population trends  
- Range polygons  
- Threat classification under standardized criteria  
- Global institutional review process

### 4. Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)

- Mammalian occurrence records with spatial and temporal metadata  
- Museum specimens and vetted observation networks  
- Cross-institutional aggregation

### 5. Long-Term Ecological Monitoring Programs

- NEON (United States)  
- European LTER  
- African, Australasian, and South American mammal monitoring initiatives  

Provide replicated, population-level datasets.

## Minimal Externally Measurable Variable Set

### Morphology & Physiology
- body mass  
- metabolic rate  
- thermoregulatory range  

### Life History
- gestation length  
- litter size  
- age at maturity  
- inter-birth interval  

### Population & Space
- population density  
- occupancy probability  
- range extent  
- dispersal or migration distance  

### Temporal Structure (τ)
- seasonal breeding cycles  
- multi-year population oscillations  
- generational turnover rates  

All variables are externally observable, repeatable, and independent of individual identity.

---

## Replication and Observer Independence

- Independent institutions report consistent scaling relationships  
- Measurement methods are standardized and documented  
- Results replicate across continents, taxa, and decades  
- Uncertainty and error bounds are explicitly reported in source datasets

---

## Falsifiability Statement (Non-Negotiable)

The LDSF classification for mammalogy must be revised or rejected if:

1. Mammalian life-history variables fail cross-species replication.  
2. Population structure cannot be independently measured by separate institutions.  
3. Physiological scaling laws collapse under empirical testing.  
4. Observed structure reduces entirely to isolated, non-comparable individual observations.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ anchors mammalogy in quantitative biological data  
- ✔ supports shared-field classification without metaphysics  
- ✔ remains compatible across UCC, UDC, and related frameworks  

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer cognition or consciousness  
- ✖ assign ethical or symbolic meaning  
- ✖ privilege any species or taxonomic group
