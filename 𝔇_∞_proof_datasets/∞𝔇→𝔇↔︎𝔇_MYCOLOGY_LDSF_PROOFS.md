# MYCOLOGY — LDSF Empirical Proof Datasets

## Purpose
This document provides **quantitative, peer-reviewable empirical anchors** supporting **fungal systems (mycology)** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

It follows a strict audit chain:

**Externally measurable claim → numeric variables → authoritative datasets/institutions → falsifiability conditions**

No symbolic, metaphysical, ethical, or interpretive extensions are introduced.

---

## UCC Claim Being Validated
> **Claim:**  
> Fungal systems constitute shared biological fields characterized by persistent, measurable network structure, population-level material transport, and reproducible ecological coupling across spatial and temporal scales, independent of any single organism.

---

## 1) External Definition Scope (Taxonomy & Identity Anchors)
Fungal identity and nomenclature are externally anchored via **international, curated repositories** used by the discipline.

### 1.1 Taxonomic backbone (curated, versioned)
| Anchor | What it provides | Why it is an LDSF-quality external reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Index Fungorum** | names + nomenclatural status across fungi | global curation; persistent identifiers |
| **MycoBank** | names + metadata; registration infrastructure | global curation; persistent identifiers |
| **International mycological nomenclature governance (context)** | linkage between repositories and standardized naming practice | demonstrates cross-institution stability |

Evidence that Index Fungorum and MycoBank function as major nomenclatural repositories is explicitly described in formal mycological governance literature.  [oai_citation:0‡BMC Microbiology](https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s43008-024-00150-z?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 1.2 DNA-based identity anchors (sequence registries / curated ITS)
| Anchor | What it provides | Typical measurable outputs |
|---|---|---|
| **UNITE** (fungal ITS reference system) | curated fungal ITS hypotheses / reference sequences used for metabarcoding | ITS clustering, reference labels, assignment confidence |
| **INSDC sequence repositories** (GenBank/ENA/DDBJ; commonly used in fungal genomics pipelines) | public sequence deposition and retrieval | accession counts; alignment identity; phylogenies |

UNITE is a standard curated fungal ITS resource used to support reproducible identification in fungal ecology and metabarcoding workflows.  [oai_citation:1‡Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Awwducational/comments/omprot/the_largest_known_living_organism_is_a_fungus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 2) Core LDSF Variable Families (Minimal Measured Set)
The LDSF claim is testable if (and only if) independent groups can measure the following variable families reproducibly.

| Variable family | Minimal measurable fields | Typical units / forms | Typical measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Network geometry** | hyphal diameter; branching rate; network density; connectivity | µm; branches/mm; nodes/area; graph metrics | microscopy + image analysis; 3D reconstruction |
| **Growth kinetics** | tip extension rate; colony radial growth | µm/s; mm/day | time-lapse assays; controlled culture |
| **Biomass / abundance** | fungal biomass C; hyphal length density; gene copy proxies | mg C/g soil; m hyphae/g soil; qPCR counts | fumigation-extraction; microscopy; qPCR/metabarcoding |
| **Decomposition flux** | mass loss rate; CO₂ efflux; enzyme activity | %/time; g C m⁻² day⁻¹; activity units | litterbags; respiration chambers; enzyme assays |
| **Transport / exchange** | isotopic transfer of C/N/P via mycorrhizae | atom %; mg transferred; fraction of uptake | ¹³C/¹⁵N tracing; compartment experiments |
| **Distribution** | occurrence records (lat/long/time); habitat | geospatial/time | specimen + observation + sequencing localities |

---

## 3) Quantitative Parameter Anchors (Representative Ranges)
These ranges are intended as **measurement anchors** (not universals). Values vary by species, substrate, temperature, nutrient status, and method.

### 3.1 Hyphal-scale geometry and growth
| Variable | Representative measured range | Units | Common measurement method |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Hyphal diameter | ~2–10 | µm | light/confocal microscopy |
| Tip extension rate | ~0.1–10 | mm/day | time-lapse growth in defined media |
| Spore size | ~2–20 | µm | microscopy |
| Colony / mycelial extent | meters to very large genets (landscape scale) | m → km-scale | field mapping + genetics + remote/ground survey |

Large *Armillaria* genets on the order of **hundreds to ~1,000 hectares** have been reported in the Malheur National Forest “humongous fungus” literature stream (field genetics + mapping narratives), demonstrating that fungal “individuals” can be spatially extensive and persist long-term.  [oai_citation:2‡ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1754504824000783?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3.2 Soil microbial biomass context (fungi as a measurable biomass compartment)
Soil biochemistry references and methods describe fungal biomass as a distinct, measurable pool with different stoichiometry than bacteria (e.g., C:N differences), supporting externally measurable “field compartments” in soils.  [oai_citation:3‡Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/assets/nrel_files/labs/paul-lab/docs/Smith_Chap7_SoilBiochem.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 4) Ecosystem-Scale Function (Externally Measured Couplings)
The LDSF claim requires that fungal systems demonstrate **repeatable coupling** to external constraints and fluxes (carbon, nitrogen, water availability, temperature, substrate chemistry).

### 4.1 Decomposition and carbon cycling (measured via litter/wood decay + respiration)
| Observable | Measured variable | How it is measured | Cross-site replication status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Litter mass loss | % mass remaining vs time | litterbags; standardized substrates | replicated globally in decomposition networks |
| CO₂ production | soil respiration / litter respiration | chambers; gas flux methods | replicated across biomes and long-term sites |
| Enzyme function | lignocellulose enzyme activities | standardized assays | replicated; method-dependent uncertainty |

### 4.2 Global microbiome-scale evidence base (standardized meta-analysis)
The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) meta-analysis aggregates microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers under coordinated protocols, providing a large-scale empirical substrate for fungal ecological patterning across environments.  [oai_citation:4‡Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/6192678?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 5) Primary Global / International Data Infrastructure (Where the “Proof Data” Lives)
This section lists **datasets and institutions** that can be used to independently test the LDSF claim, with typical measurable outputs.

| Dataset / institution | What you can extract numerically | Typical scale |
|---|---|---|
| **Index Fungorum / MycoBank** | counts of accepted names; synonymy; nomenclatural events; persistent identifiers | global |
| **UNITE** | reference sequences; ITS hypotheses; assignment confidence / clusters | global |
| **Earth Microbiome Project** | fungal community presence/absence/relative abundance in multi-environment samples | global meta-analysis |
| **Long-term ecological research networks** (forest/soil sites) | time-series of decomposition, soil respiration, climate constraints | multi-decadal (site dependent) |
| **GBIF / museum collections + national fungaria** | occurrence density; observation effort; specimen verification | global, multi-century archives |
| **Peer-reviewed mycorrhizal tracer literature** | rates of C/N transfer under controlled and field designs | experiment-dependent |

(EMP as a cross-lab meta-analysis anchor is explicitly documented in the published EMP meta-analysis paper.)  [oai_citation:5‡Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/6192678?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 6) Replication & Observer Independence Criteria (Operational)
A claim qualifies as “shared-field empirical” only if it satisfies all checks below:

| Criterion | Minimum requirement | Example pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-lab measurability** | ≥2 independent labs/sites reproduce the same variable family | hyphal diameter distributions overlap within reported uncertainty |
| **Method transparency** | protocols + uncertainty reported | confidence intervals / SD / posterior intervals included |
| **Cross-context robustness** | effects observable across substrates/biomes (with parameter shifts) | decomposition curves remain measurable and model-fit-able |
| **Identity stability** | taxa/OTUs traceable to curated references | sequences map to UNITE hypotheses with recorded confidence |

---

## 7) Stress-Test Questions (Designed for Criticism Waves)
These are the standard “attack surfaces” reviewers use; each is answerable with the datasets above.

1. **Sampling bias:** Are fungal distributions artifacts of observer effort?  
   *Test:* compare occurrence density vs sampling effort; verify with independent sequencing surveys (UNITE/EMP).

2. **Method dependence:** Do conclusions flip under different biomass or sequencing pipelines?  
   *Test:* require concordance across at least two measurement classes (e.g., microscopy + molecular proxy).

3. **Causality vs correlation in decomposition:** Are fungi necessary or just co-present?  
   *Test:* exclusion/addition experiments + enzyme activity + isotopic partitioning (peer-reviewed designs).

4. **Network claims inflation:** Are “networks” just metaphors?  
   *Test:* treat as graph-measurable geometry: nodes/edges/density; publish method + uncertainty.

---

## 8) Falsifiability Statement (Non-negotiable, Quantified Triggers)
This LDSF classification **must be revised** if any of the following becomes true under modern measurement standards:

1. **Network geometry non-replicable:** independent labs cannot reproduce core geometry metrics (diameter distributions, branching density) within stated uncertainty bounds for the same species/substrate class.
2. **Transport non-demonstrable:** isotopic tracer studies repeatedly fail to detect measurable C/N/P transfer via fungal pathways under conditions where transfer is claimed.
3. **Ecosystem coupling not measurable:** decomposition/respiration/enzyme metrics cannot be measured reproducibly across sites using standardized methods.
4. **Identity non-traceable:** fungal identities cannot be anchored to curated nomenclatural and sequence reference systems (nomenclature + ITS reference collapse).

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted; only removal or revision of the affected applied statements.
