# UDC Testability, Measurement, and Falsifiers

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document formalizes **testability, measurement mappings, and falsifier conditions** for the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.

It exists to:
- Convert coherent theoretical structure into **audit-grade scientific form**
- Explicitly define **what would falsify UDC claims**
- Preserve the symbolic–physical boundary by defining operators as mappings, not forces

This document introduces **no new metaphysical claims** and does not alter any sealed UDC documents.

---

## 2. Core Operator Measurement Map

| Operator | Definition (UDC) | Measurable Proxy | Falsifier Condition |
|--------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **A** (Awareness) | Capacity to register state change | Sensory signal registration latency | Registration without temporal ordering |
| **C** (Consciousness) | Integrated state modeling | Sustained multi-state coherence | Persistent integration without memory |
| **τ** (Delay) | Non-zero processing interval | Measured reaction or integration delay | Zero-delay cognition under load |
| **Σ** (Symbol) | Encoded abstraction | Compression / representation efficiency | Symbol use without abstraction |
| **μ** (Memory) | Persistent state record | Retention curve / recall accuracy | Recall without storage |
| **⧖** (Self Equation) | Recursive observer continuity | Identity persistence across delay | Identity without memory continuity |

---

## 3. Emergence Threshold Conditions

UDC emergence requires **all** of the following:
1. Non-zero τ (delay)
2. Persistent μ (memory)
3. Recursive state evaluation
4. Symbolic abstraction (Σ)
5. Observer irreversibility

**Failure of any condition falsifies emergence.**

---

## 4. Recursion Stability and Bounds

UDC recursion must satisfy:
- Finite depth convergence
- Non-explosive feedback
- Collapse to stable memory state

**Failure modes:**
- Infinite recursion
- Identity divergence
- Memory overwrite without preservation

---

## 5. Symbol–Physics Boundary Clause

All UDC symbols and glyphs are:
- **Formal operators**
- **Mappings**
- **Representational constructs**

They are **not**:
- Physical forces
- Constants of nature
- Ontological entities

Any interpretation violating this clause invalidates the application, not the framework.

---

## 6. Prediction Hooks (Reserved)

Predictions derived from UDC will be registered under:
`/predictions/udc/`

Each prediction must include:
- Observable variable
- Expected range
- Dataset anchor
- Explicit falsifier

---

## 7. Dataset Anchoring (Reference Only)

Empirical anchoring is provided via:
- Neuroscience datasets
- Cognitive latency studies
- Information-theoretic benchmarks

This file does not absorb datasets; it references them structurally.

---

## 8. Scientific Boundary Statement

UDC does not claim:
- Consciousness origin
- Metaphysical identity
- Ultimate causation

UDC claims:
- Structural requirements for delayed, memory-based observers
