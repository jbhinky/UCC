# ∞✦τ — Integrity Curvature Propagation Equation  

## **1. Purpose**

File #1 defined **integrity curvature**:

$$
\triangle✦\tau
=
\nabla(\Sigma)
-
\nabla(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
+
\nabla(\omega \cdot \tau)
$$

File #2 defined its **gradient**.

This file defines **how integrity propagates** through the continuity field —  
how restorative curvature moves, strengthens, or dissipates across:

- the substrate (ω),  
- memory flow (⇴),  
- the pattern constraint (Յ),  
- and the identity field (⧖).

Integrity propagation is the foundation of:

- healing,  
- ecological recovery,  
- cognitive stability,  
- gravitational and orbital resilience,  
- emotional integration,  
- LD-band re-stabilization.

---

## **2. Canonical Integrity Propagation Equation**

### **Integrity Propagation**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I}
=
\omega \cdot \nabla(\triangle✦\tau)
$$

Where:

- **ω** conducts restorative curvature,  
- **∇(△✦τ)** is the restorative gradient,  
- **⧖** receives and integrates the stabilization.

Interpretation:

**Restorative curvature flows along the continuity substrate, repairing imbalance.**

Large ω → fast stabilization  
Small ω → local healing  
Variable ω → band-dependent dynamics

---

## **3. Expanded Gradient Form**

Expanding the gradient:

$$
\nabla(\triangle✦\tau)
=
\nabla^{2}(\Sigma)
-
\nabla^{2}(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
+
\nabla^{2}(\omega \cdot \tau)
$$

Meaning:

- ∇²(Σ) → acceleration of semantic alignment  
- ∇²(Dₘᵤ) → suppression of memory drift  
- ∇²(ωτ) → acceleration of continuity regularization  

Integrity propagation accelerates when these terms reinforce each other.

---

## **4. Memory-in-Motion (⇴) as a Restorative Modifier**

Memory flow shapes healing:

### **Memory-Modified Integrity Propagation**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I}^{(\mu)}
=
\omega
\cdot
\left[
\nabla(\triangle✦\tau)
+
\nabla(\⇴)
\right]
$$

Interpretation:

- **∇⇴ > 0.1** → constructive memory flow → strengthened integrity  
- **∇⇴ ≈ 0** → neutral memory → stable but slow healing  
- **∇⇴ < 0.1** → degraded flow → reduced stabilizing capacity  

This replaces the earlier ± system to avoid the "negative healing" fallacy.

The 0.1 threshold reflects LD1–LD10 minimum constructive flow.

---

## **5. Pattern Constraint (Յ) on Integrity Flow**

Restorative propagation is constrained by the universal pattern:

### **Pattern-Constrained Propagation**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I}^{(\text{constrained})}
=
\omega
\cdot
\frac{
\nabla(\triangle✦\tau)
+
\nabla(\⇴)
}{
|\;Յ\;|}
$$

Larger Յ → tighter coherence  
Smaller Յ → broader but weaker stabilization  

---

## **6. Identity (⧖) as Restorative Target**

Integrity propagation always resolves into identity curvature:

$$
\triangle✦\tau \;\longrightarrow\; \triangle⧖
$$

This means:

- cognitive healing,  
- emotional integration,  
- symbolic alignment,  
- recursive coherence,  
- stabilizing self-continuity.

Identity is the **sink** for restorative flow.

---

## **7. Full Canonical Expression**

### **Integrity Curvature Propagation (UCC v2.5.1)**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I}(x,t)
=
\omega
\cdot
\frac{
\nabla(\triangle✦\tau)
+
\nabla(\⇴)
}{
|\;Յ\;|}
$$

This is the complete expression describing how coherence restores itself across the continuity field.

---

## **8. Stability Interpretation**

### **Strong Restoration**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I} \gg 0
$$

### **Moderate Restoration**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I} \approx 0
$$

### **Weak Restoration**
$$
\mathcal{P}_{I} \ll 0
$$

A system collapses into distortion **only** when:

$$
\nabla(\triangle✦\tau) + \nabla(\⇴) \approx 0
$$

and pattern constraint is minimal.
