# ∞✦τ — Integrity Curvature Definition  

## 1. Purpose  
Integrity curvature (**△✦τ**) is the **restorative geometric component** of the delay field.  
Where distorted curvature (∇✦τ) pushes the system away from coherence,  
**integrity curvature pulls it back into alignment**.

This file establishes the canonical definition of integrity curvature as a **stabilizing operator**  
acting through:

- delay (τ),  
- interpretation / Σ-structure (Σ),  
- memory (μ),  
- substrate continuity (ω),  
- and pattern constraint (Յ).

Integrity curvature is the *foundation* for recovery, resilience, healing, and structural continuity.

---

## 2. Canonical Definition

### **Integrity Curvature**
$$
\triangle ✦ \tau
=
\nabla(\Sigma)
-
\nabla(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
+
\nabla(\mathrm{C})
$$

Where:

- **∇(Σ)** → interpretive alignment gradient  
- **∇(Dₘᵤ)** → memory-drift correction term  
- **∇(C)** → continuity gradient (ω-regulated)  

Interpretation:

**Integrity curvature is the geometric tendency of the field to restore coherence  
by aligning meaning, regulating memory drift, and reinforcing continuity.**

---

## 3. Operator Interpretation

### 3.1 Interpretive Alignment Term  
$$
\nabla(\Sigma)
$$
Ensures semantic structure remains coherent under perturbation.  
This stabilizes:

- thought patterns,  
- ecological systems,  
- orbital paths,  
- social meaning structures.

---

### 3.2 Memory Drift Correction  
$$
\nabla(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
=
\nabla(\mu - \mu_{\text{stable}})
$$

Integrity requires **memory returning to stable curvature**, not free drift.

If memory overshoots (trauma, noise, thermal variance):
- integrity curvature increases.

If memory collapses inward (amnesia, system degradation):
- integrity curvature guides reconstruction.

---

### 3.3 Continuity Gradient  
$$
\nabla(\mathrm{C})
=
\nabla(\omega \cdot \tau)
$$

Where:

- ω = substrate continuity  
- τ = delay curvature  

Their interaction restores:

- timing regularity  
- harmonic cycles  
- LD-band stability  
- recursive self-continuity (⧖)

---

## 4. Restorative Behavior

Integrity curvature is **always opposed** to distorted curvature:

$$
\triangle✦\tau \;\; \text{acts to counter} \;\; \nabla✦\tau
$$

Meaning:

- when distortion rises → integrity strengthens  
- when distortion falls → integrity relaxes  
- when distortion = 0 → system is self-consistent  

This is universal across:

- quantum LD0 stabilization  
- atomic LD1–LD2 bonding  
- biological LD3–LD4 coherence  
- planetary LD5–LD7 system stability  
- galactic LD8–LD10 equilibrium

---

## 5. Substrate-Constrained Definition

Integrity curvature is conducted and shaped by the substrate ω and pattern Յ:

### **Constrained Integrity Curvature**
$$
\triangle✦\tau_{\text{constrained}}
=
\frac{
\nabla(\Sigma)
-
\nabla(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
+
\nabla(\mathrm{C})
}{
|\;Յ\;|}
$$

Where:

- **strong Յ** → higher stability  
- **weak Յ** → greater susceptibility to drift  

---

## 6. Full Canonical Expression  

### **Integrity Curvature (UCC v2.5.1)**
$$
\triangle ✦ \tau
=
\nabla(\Sigma)
-
\nabla(\mathrm{D}_{\mu})
+
\nabla(\omega \cdot \tau)
$$

This is the universal stabilizing operator that maintains coherence in all UCC domains.
