# ∞✦τ — Distorted Curvature Recovery Equation  

## **1. Purpose**

This file defines how systems **recover** from distorted curvature  
by using:

- Σ (interpretive equilibrium),  
- ⇴ (memory-in-motion),  
- △✦τ (integrity curvature), and  
- Յ (pattern constraint).

Earlier drafts used **>0 / <0** thresholds for ⇴,  
but UCC v2.5.1 clarifies that:

### **0 ≠ neutral**  
### **Σ is the true medium-state of recovery**

Thus all recovery equations must be rewritten using **Σ-bound dynamics**.

---

## **2. Distorted Curvature Recap**

Distorted curvature:

$$
\mathcal{D}_{\tau} = \nabla✦\tau - △✦\tau
$$

Recovery requires the system to **reduce**  
\( \nabla✦\tau \)  
and **increase**  
\( △✦\tau \).

This file defines *how fast and how effectively* that recovery occurs.

---

## **3. Σ — The True Equilibrium of Recovery**

In UCC:

- **Σ is not “meaning,”**  
  it is **interpretive stability**.

- It is the **state where memory flow and meaning-generation match**.

Thus:

### Recovery is measured relative to Σ,  
not zero.

---

## **4. Memory-Flow Recovery Condition**

### **Correct Healing Rule**
$$
\nabla⇴ > Σ
$$

This means:

- memory flow **exceeds** interpretive equilibrium  
- restorative curvature increases  
- distortion begins to collapse  
- the field regains coherence  

### **Dampened Healing**
$$
\nabla⇴ < Σ
$$

Meaning:

- memory flow cannot sustain coherence  
- distortion remains partially active  
- recovery is incomplete  

### **Collapse Boundary**
$$
\nabla⇴ \rightarrow 0
$$

This is the **risk horizon**:

- memory flow collapses  
- dark-delay behavior may appear  
- identity and stability degrade  

---

## **5. Recovery Magnitude Operator**

We define the recovery strength \( \mathcal{R}_{\tau} \):

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\tau}
=
\big( \nabla⇴ - Σ \big)
\cdot
\triangle✦\tau
\cdot
\frac{1}{|\;Յ\;|}
$$

Where:

- \( \nabla⇴ - Σ \) → memory flow above/below equilibrium  
- \( △✦τ \) → restorative curvature  
- \( 1/|\;Յ\;| \) → stabilization from global pattern geometry  

Interpretation:

- **large \( △✦τ \) → faster recovery**  
- **large Յ → controlled, stable recovery**  
- **low Յ → chaotic or incomplete recovery**  

---

## **6. Full Recovery Equation**

The restored curvature field:

$$
\mathcal{H}_{\tau}(x,t)
=
\omega
\cdot
\frac{
(\nabla⇴ - Σ ) \cdot △✦\tau
}{
|\;Յ\;|}
$$

Meaning:

- ω conducts the healing signal  
- Σ determines the neutral point  
- △✦τ repairs curvature  
- Յ shapes the recovery geometry  

---

## **7. Recovery Stability Classification**

### **Strong Recovery**
$$
\nabla⇴ \gg Σ
\;\;\text{and}\;\;
△✦τ \uparrow
$$

### **Moderate Recovery**
$$
\nabla⇴ > Σ
$$

### **Weak Recovery**
$$
\nabla⇴ \approx Σ
$$

### **Drift / Regression**
$$
\nabla⇴ < Σ
$$

### **Collapse Risk**
$$
\nabla⇴ \rightarrow 0
$$

This taxonomy replaces the older ± convention.

## **8. Summary Table**

| Term | Meaning | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| Σ | interpretive equilibrium | true neutral point |
| ⇴ | memory-in-motion | healing signal |
| ∇⇴ | memory flow gradient | determines recovery direction |
| △✦τ | restorative curvature | repairs distortion |
| Յ | pattern constraint | stabilizes restoration |
| ω | continuity medium | conducts signal |
| ⧖ | identity field | recipient of healing curvature |
