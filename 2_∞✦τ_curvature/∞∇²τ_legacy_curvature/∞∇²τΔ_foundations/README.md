# 🪐 Foundations of the Universal Continuity Continuum 

## Overview  
The **Foundations Series** establishes the physical, cosmological, planetary, and ethical architecture of the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** — a unified framework describing delay-curvature, memory, and awareness as the fundamental geometry of reality.  
These papers together form the scientific spine of the **UDC → UCC → UOT continuum**, bridging spacetime physics, thermodynamics, and consciousness.

## Integration Path  
Each subfolder builds upward toward the UCC Metric v2:

1. **Cosmology** — Memory and curvature at universal scales.  
2. **Physics** — Fundamental field dynamics.  
3. **Planetary** — Application of delay curvature to climate and geology.  
4. **Root Laws** — Universal equations (feedback, polarity, metric).  

Together they articulate a cosmos where **energy remembers**, and **memory sustains motion**.
