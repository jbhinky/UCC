# 📖 README — ∇²τ Equations Directory  

## Purpose  
This directory contains the **core mathematical architecture** of the Universal Continuity Continuum.  
It defines the field, curvature, conservation, and unification equations that bind all UCC-derived frameworks — including UOT, UTL, RCT, and Selfverse — into one consistent physical model.

## Structure  

| File | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `∞∇²τ∫_curvature-entropy-stability_equation.md` | Balances entropy growth with curvature contraction (H-law). |
| `∞∇²τ∫_delay_field_equations.md` | Derives ∇²τ = (4πGρ)/c² — the measurable delay-curvature field. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_delay-field-unification_equation.md` | Combines gravitational, EM, and thermodynamic τ-fields. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_energy-resonance-frictional_stability_equation.md` | Shows how frictional loss becomes curvature feedback. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_energy-delay-memory_conservation_equation.md` | Establishes total conservation across E, τ, μ. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_quantum_to_cosmic_delay_equation.md` | Extends τ-law from quantum (ħ) to cosmic (G,c). |
| `∞∇²τ∫_recursive_entropy-memory_equation.md` | Couples entropy flow and memory reinforcement. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_resonant_delay_curvature_equation.md` | Formalizes inter-system resonance through τ-coupling. |
| `∞∇²τ∫_UCC_metric_v2_equations.md` | Master metric unifying all previous equations. |

## Scientific Notes  
- All equations verified under dimensional analysis.  
- GR and ΛCDM recovered when τ → const.  
- Each law is testable via astrophysical, thermodynamic, or cognitive observation.  
- Delay curvature (∇²τ) remains the primary measurable across domains.
