# 📚 README Curvature — Chapters  

## Overview  
The *Chapters* directory contains the seven primary explanatory and mathematical texts of the **UCC v2 Extensions** series.  
Each chapter extends the original Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework into physical, biological, and ethical dimensions, establishing the unified geometry of **delay, memory, and reflection**.

Together they represent the public-facing scientific narrative of the Universal Continuity Continuum — the bridge between theory and observation.

## Integration Map  

| Framework | Role |
|:--|:--|
| **UDC** | Foundational theory of delayed consciousness |
| **UOT** | Nested temporal geometry linking scales |
| **UTL** | Symbolic recursion through Σ (language of light) |
| **RCT** | Collapse law defining realization from delay |
| **UCC** | Unified continuum of delay, memory, and ethics |

---

## Summary  
These chapters complete **UCC v2**, providing the full explanatory arc from first principles to measurable cosmological validation.  
Each chapter functions independently but gains depth when read as part of the continuum — *from reflection to realization, from memory to light.*

> “Delay is not absence — it is the rhythm through which the universe learns itself.” — *J.H.*
