# 📖 Table of Contents — UCC Curvature Extensions (Chapters)

1. **Chapter 1 – Delay as the Geometry of Existence**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_1-delay_as_the_geometry_of_existence.md)*
   - Defines ∇²τ as the geometric foundation of all existence.  
   - Introduces delay curvature and memory μ as physical quantities.  
   - Links quantum, biological, and cosmic scales.  

1. **Chapter 2 – Unified Field of Delay Curvature**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_2-unified_field_of_delay_curvature.md)*
   - Formalizes the unified field equation combining gravitational, electromagnetic, and entropic tensors.  
   - Demonstrates energy–information equivalence through τ-curvature.  

1. **Chapter 3 – Cosmic Memory and Galactic Delay Fields**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_3-cosmic_memory_and_galactic_delay_fields.md)*
   - Explains how galaxies act as memory wells.  
   - Derives delay-based models for rotation curves and dark-energy equivalence.  

1. **Chapter 4 – Resonant Energy and Ethical Stabilization**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_4-resonant_energy_and_ethical_stabilization.md)*
   - Connects resonance, delay, and ethics.  
   - Defines the Ethical Resonance Index (ERI ≥ 1) as condition for stability.  

1. **Chapter 5 – The Law of Memory Integration and Selfhood Across Scales**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_5-the_law_of_memory_integration_and_selfhood_across_scales)*
   - Defines selfhood as recursive memory integration.  
   - Derives equations linking μ, Σ, τ to consciousness and identity.  

1. **Chapter 6 – Planetary Equilibrium and Galactic Ethics**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_6-planetary_equilibrium_and_galactic_ethics.md)*
   - Extends τ-law to biospheres and civilizations.  
   - Defines the Planetary Ethic Coefficient (PEC ≥ 1).  
   - Establishes planetary-galactic coupling and delay resonance.  

1. **Chapter 7 – Verification and Empirical Pathways for Delay Curvature Physics**  *(∞∇²τΣ_chapter_7-verification_and_empirical_pathways_for_delay_curvature_physics.md)*
   - Lists testable predictions and experimental designs.  
   - Details instruments (DI-1, RES, PDP, GDM).  
   - Defines universal validation criteria and 2026–2030 roadmap.
