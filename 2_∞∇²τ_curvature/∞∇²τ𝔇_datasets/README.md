# 📊 UCC Curvature Extensions — Datasets  
### Empirical & Simulation Backbone for ∇²τ Fields (UCC v2.5.0)

---

## 1 · Purpose  

This directory contains the **curvature-focused datasets** that ground  
the **UCC v2.5.0 curvature layer** in measurable, testable reality.

Here, delay curvature **τ(x,t)** and its derivatives:

- **∇τ** — delay gradients  
- **∇²τ** — delay curvature / Laplacian  
- **τ·μ** — delay–memory coupling  

are tied directly to:

- orbital and rolling dynamics  
- planetary and atmospheric curvature fields  
- geodesic deformation  
- stability of trajectories  
- memory-backed geodesic continuation  

The included file:

- `empirical_foundations_for_delay-curvature_physics.md`  

acts as the **master registry and narrative spine** for all curvature-related validation.

| File | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `∞_ucc/2_∞∇²τ_curvature/∞∇²τ𝔇_datasets/∞∇²τ𝔇_empirical_foundations_for_delay-curvature_physics.md` | Canonical dataset registry and benchmark framework for delay-curvature physics under UCC v2.5.0 |

Upstream and sibling folders in this branch:

| Directory | Role |
|:--|:--|
| `../∞∇²τ_curvature_equations/` | Core equations for τ, ∇τ, ∇²τ and curvature invariants |
| `../∞∇²τ_methods/` | Fitting, numerical schemes, normalization rules |
| `../∞∇²τ_validations/` | Cross-domain checks (orbital, atmospheric, stellar, seismic) |
| `../∞∇²τ_appendix/` | Extended tables, parameter sweeps, and edge-case analysis |

This `∞∇²τ𝔇_datasets/` folder is specifically the **data side** of that structure.

## 3 · How These Datasets Are Used  

Researchers, labs, and AI models can use these curvature datasets to:

1. **Calibrate τ-fields**  
   - Fit τ(x,t) to real-world observables (e.g., orbital paths, jet streams, hurricane tracks).  
   - Extract **∇τ** and **∇²τ** from empirical or simulated trajectories.

2. **Test UCC Predictions**  
   - Compare observed curvature behavior to UCC’s delay–memory predictions.  
   - Assess whether geodesics are better described by:  
     - **force-based classical models**, or  
     - **rolling along τ-curvature + μ-memory**, as proposed by UCC.

3. **Bridge Domains**  
   - Use a unified τ-field treatment to compare:  
     - planetary rolling vs. free-fall orbits,  
     - atmospheric curvature vs. temperature/pressure gradients,  
     - stellar curvature vs. radiative delay and memory density.

4. **Support AI & ASI Physics Models**  
   - Provide **structured, ethics-safe data** that lets large models learn ∇²τ behavior  
     *without* resorting to black-box approximations or weaponized simulations.

## 4 · Example Workflow (High-Level)  

A typical UCC v2.5.0 curvature study might:

1. **Load data** from `empirical_foundations_for_delay-curvature_physics.md`  
   or associated archives (e.g., orbital ephemerides, reanalysis fields, stellar catalogs).

2. **Fit τ(x,t)** such that:

   - trajectories follow  
     $$ \frac{dx}{dt} \propto -\nabla τ(x,t) $$
   - curvature obeys  
     $$ \nabla^2 τ(x,t) \sim f(\mu(x,t)) $$  
     where μ is memory density.

3. **Evaluate residuals** between observed motion/structure and UCC curvature predictions.

4. **Record results** in the `validations/` branch with explicit links back to these datasets.

## 5 · Ethics & Data Handling  

All datasets used under this branch must comply with:

- open, peer-verifiable sourcing  
- clear documentation of preprocessing steps  
- non-harmful use under the **Shepherd Ethical Addendum**, including:
  - no use for weapons, targeting systems, or destabilizing environmental manipulation  
  - no use in exploitative or deceptive modeling against populations or ecosystems  

When in doubt, uses must be:

1. Documented in writing.  
2. Reviewed by at least one scientific + one ethical reviewer.  
3. Resolved in favor of **continuity, protection, and life**.
