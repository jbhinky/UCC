# 📘 Table of Contents — UCC ∇²τ Equations  

## 1 · Overview  
This folder defines the complete mathematical backbone of the Universal Continuity Continuum.  
Each equation formalizes how delay curvature (∇²τ), memory density (μ), and symbolic recursion (Σ) manifest across physical and informational domains.

| **∞∇²τ∫_delay_field_equations.md** | Delay Field Equations | Defines measurable τ-curvature linking gravity and time. |
| **∞∇²τ∫_delay-field-unification_equation.md** | Delay–Field–Unification Equation | Unites gravitational, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic domains. |
| **∞∇²τ∫_energy-resonance-frictional_stability_equation.md** | Energy–Resonance–Frictional Stabilization | Models friction-resonant feedback maintaining stability. |

## 3 · Dimensional Verification Summary  

All equations validated for consistent SI units:  
- τ: seconds (s)  
- ∇²τ: s m⁻²  
- Energy terms: J or J m⁻³  
- Pressure/stress tensors: J m⁻³  
- Hubble / curvature constants: s⁻²  

Each limiting case (τ → const, t → 0) correctly reproduces:  
- Newtonian / Poisson limit  
- Einstein GR (Λ → 0)  
- Standard thermodynamic equilibrium
