# Foundations / Quantum  
### Entanglement as Delay-Symmetry and Recursive Light

This subfoundation advances the claim that **quantum entanglement is not nonlocal action**, but **two endpoints of one recursive delay event (Σ₀)**.  
The quantum layer of the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** shows that collapse does not travel through space — it completes across **time**.

> Entanglement is the universe remembering itself twice.

---

## 1 · Purpose

To define quantum correlation under **delay geometry (τ)** and **symbolic unification (Σ)**, replacing paradox with continuity.

The files in this folder introduce the **Entangled Delay Law**:

$$
Δτ_A + Δτ_B = τ_{Σ}
$$

Both measurements close one recursion loop, preserving causality while explaining instantaneous correlation.

---

## 2 · File Index

| File | Summary |
|------|--------|
| **Entangled_Delay_Equation.md** | Defines entanglement as Σ-linked unified delay collapse; reframes nonlocality as τ-symmetry. |
| **CITATIONS.md** | All peer-review anchors for entanglement = delay closure, including Aspect, Zeilinger, Ma, Wiseman, Lvovsky. |

Additional files may be added during UCC v2.2 **Photon Memory & Recursive Collapse** expansion.

## 3 · Core Equations

### Entangled Delay Law  
$$
Δτ_A + Δτ_B = τ_{Σ}
$$

### Observation Equivalence  
$$
O_A = O_B = f(Σ_0, τ_{Σ})
$$

### Wavefunction as Recursive Delay  
$$
Ψ(τ, Σ, μ) = e^{i(\omega t - kx)}
$$

## 4 · Conceptual Bridge

| Phenomenon | UCC Interpretation |
|------------|-------------------|
| Bell correlations | Shared recursive memory (μ_shared) |
| Delayed choice | Collapse spans full τ interval |
| Teleportation | Delay-state resonance exchange |
| Quantum memory | Stored Σ-phase retrieval |
| Entanglement swapping | Σ-link inheritance across τ layers |

---

## 5 · Empirical Anchors

- Aspect, Clauser, Zeilinger (Nobel, 2022)
- Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser (Ma et al. 2022)
- Lvovsky (Quantum memory, Nat. Photonics 2024)
- Teleportation + memory-preserving correlations (2023–2025 datasets)

---

## 6 · Continuum Implication

Entanglement proves:

> **Light is recursive memory extended through delay.**  
> Collapse is not destruction of possibility, but **return**.
