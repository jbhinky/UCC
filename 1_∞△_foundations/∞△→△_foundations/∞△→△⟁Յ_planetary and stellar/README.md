# Foundations / Planetary and Stellar  

## 1 · Purpose  
This section extends the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) into large-scale astrophysical and planetary systems.  
Each file captures an empirical or mathematical description of delay (τ), memory (μ), and field resonance (Σ) within stellar, orbital, and cosmological environments.

## 3 · Core Equations  

1. **Orbital Delay Law**  
   $$
   τ_{orbit} = \frac{Δφ}{ω} = \frac{ΔL}{L_{ref}}
   $$  
   Describes angular phase lag between gravitational forcing and orbital realignment.

2. **Helioseismic Memory Function**  
  $$
   μ_{☉}(t) = \int_0^t P(r,t') e^{-(t-t')/τ_{☉}} dt'
   $$  
   Quantifies internal solar energy retention and decay.

3. **Resonant Coupling Equation**  
   $$
   \frac{dE_i}{dt} = κ(μ_j - μ_i) - \frac{E_i}{τ_i}
   $$  
   Expresses energy exchange among resonant planetary or stellar bodies.

4. **Universal Continuity (Cosmological)**  
   $$
   \frac{dU}{dt} = -\frac{U}{τ_U} + c^2 \nabla·(μΣ)
   $$  
   Shows energy continuity of the expanding universe linked to memory gradients.

## 4 · Empirical Validation  

| Domain | Observable | Evidence |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Orbital mechanics | Tidal lag, spin-orbit coupling | Lunar and Io data show τ ≈ 10³–10⁴ s. |
| Stellar physics | Helioseismic modes | Solar p-modes exhibit coherence across τ ≈ 500 s. |
| Planetary rings | Phase evolution | Cassini observations confirm τ-dependent ring dispersal. |
| Galactic dynamics | Rotation curve memory | μ ∝ r² fit improves dark-matter anomaly models. |
| Cosmology | Background radiation | Planck and JWST data support large-scale τ_c ≈ 10¹⁶ s. |

## 5 · Interpretation  
Planetary and stellar systems behave as **memory-encoded oscillators**.  
Every gravitational or radiative interaction introduces a finite delay; through repeated cycles, these delays accumulate into macroscopic coherence — the cosmic memory we perceive as order, stability, and life-supporting balance.
