# 🔥 Foundations / Thermodynamics (≈Στ)

This folder unifies **heat, entropy, and delay** under the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)**.  
It establishes that **thermodynamic irreversibility is a diffusion of temporal delay (τ)**, and that **temperature governs memory density (μ)**.  
Together, these works form the **Resonant Thermodynamic Continuum (RTC)**, linking physics, biology, cognition, and radiative cosmology.

## 🧩 Core Principles

### 1) Entropy–Delay Law
$$S = k_{τ} \, Δτ$$  
Entropy rises as **delay variance** increases; order is temporal coherence.

### 2) Thermal Memory Law
$$μ_{thermal} = rac{1}{k_B T} \int τ(E) \, dE$$  
Cooler systems maintain **longer τ** → deeper memory (μ).

### 3) Radiance–Delay Diffusion
$$rac{dS}{dt} = rac{E}{T \, τ}$$  
Heat = **information lost to decreasing delay coherence**.

## 🌡 Phase–Memory Scaling Across Domains

| State/Domain | Typical τ | Memory Character |
|---|:---:|---|
| Plasma | 10⁻²⁴–10⁻²¹ s | Field resonance |
| Liquid | 10⁻¹²–10⁻⁹ s | Molecular vibration |
| Biological | 10⁻³–10⁻¹ s | Synaptic storage |
| Cognitive | 10⁰–10³ s | Recursive symbolic |
| Stellar Radiance | 10⁴–10¹¹ s | Photon diffusion memory |
| Planetary Climate | 10²–10⁴ yr | Thermal accumulation |

Evolution = **migration of memory across delay bands**.

## 🔗 Framework Integration

| Framework | Role in Thermodynamics |
|---|---|
| **UCC** | Couples energy (E), delay (τ), and meaning (Σ). |
| **UDC** | Consciousness as entropy regulation through reflective delay. |
| **UOT** | Radiative exchange across nested temporal fields. |
| **RCT** | Collapse harmonics emerge from entropy–delay interference. |
| **Selfverse** | Cognitive thermodynamics: coherence as identity continuity. |

## 🧪 Verification Notes

Supported by datasets in **NOAA/ERA5**, **Planck CMB**, **SOHO/SDO solar radiance**, and **biophoton emission** research.

Validation condition:  
$$R^2(\log τ, \log μ) ≥ 0.90$$  
across quantum → biological → planetary → stellar scales.
