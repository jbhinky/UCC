# Phase Transitions and Temporal Recoherence  
### Delay Geometry in State Change Dynamics

## 1) Purpose
Phase transitions are traditionally defined as transformations between states of matter.  
Within the UCC, they are reinterpreted as **temporal recoherence processes**:  
systems re-align internal delay (τ) and memory density (μ), producing a new equilibrium state.

Thus, a phase transition is:

> **a collapse (⊙) that reconfigures the delay–memory field.**

---

## 2) Classical Basis (bridged to UCC)

Latent heat relation:

$$
Q = m L_{phase}
$$

Heat capacity relation:

$$
C = \frac{dQ}{dT}
$$

During a phase transition, temperature remains constant while **energy goes into state reconfiguration** rather than temperature rise.

---

## 3) UCC Reformulation

The UCC substitutes state change as **temporal coherence shift**:

$$
\Delta μ = \frac{Q}{T\,\tau}
$$

During phase transition, temperature \(T\) ≈ constant, so:

$$
\boxed{\Delta μ \propto \frac{1}{\tau}}
$$

**Longer delay → higher memory density retained after phase shift.**

---

## 4) Recoherence Condition (UCC Phase Law)

A phase transition completes when **delay field curvature flattens**:

$$
\frac{\partial τ}{\partial x} \to 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\text{Recoherence Achieved}
$$

This explains why solid structures have **lower delay variance** than liquids or gases.

---

## 5) Entropy–Delay Behavior Across Phases

| Phase | Delay Field | μ (memory density) | S (entropy) | Notes |
|------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|------|
| Solid | low variance (τ stable) | high | low | memory-retaining lattice |
| Liquid | moderate variance | mid | mid | mixing memory & flexibility |
| Gas | high variance | low | high | minimal temporal coherence |
| Plasma | extreme variance | very low | very high | delay field fragmenting |

Phase change corresponds to **Δτ** spike while the field reorganizes.

---

## 6) Temporal Collapse and Re-Expansion

General UCC phase transition dynamic:

$$
⊙:\;\tau \downarrow,\; μ \downarrow,\; S \uparrow
$$

Recoherence:

$$
\text{Re-cohere:}\;\tau \uparrow,\; μ \uparrow,\; S \downarrow
$$

Thus the cycle:

$$
\boxed{⊙ \rightarrow \text{Delay Expansion} \rightarrow \text{New Coherent Phase}}
$$

---

## 7) Cosmological and Cognitive Parallels

| Domain | Phase Transition Analogue |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Quantum | decoherence → collapse (⊙) |
| Stellar | plasma cooling → radiative solidification |
| Planetary | magma → crust formation |
| Biological | neural synchrony shifts (sleep/awareness cycles) |
| Cognitive | perspective change / symbolic restructuring |

Phase transitions occur **from atoms to awareness.**

---

## 8) Summary Equation (recommended citation)

$$
\boxed{
\Delta μ = \frac{Q}{T\,\tau}
}
$$

> Phase transitions are **delay-field reorganizations** that define new memory structures.
