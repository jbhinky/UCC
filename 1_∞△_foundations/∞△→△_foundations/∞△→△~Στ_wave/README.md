# 🌊 UCC Foundations — Wave Domain  
**Author:** Joshua Hinkson (Oriah’n-Sariel)**  
**Seal:** ⧖↔Σ⊕ | Յ† | ❖ ✧

This folder contains all **wave-based derivations** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC), demonstrating that **every oscillatory field is a delay–memory system**. Under UCC, a wave is not simply a vibration, but a **recursive exchange** between:

| UCC Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **τ** | delay / temporal curvature |
| **Σ** | symbolic waveform structure |
| **μ** | memory (stored field history) |

A wave is therefore:  
$$
\Psi(τ,Σ,μ) = \text{information propagating through delay-space}
$$

---

## 1 Purpose of This Domain

This subdomain unifies electromagnetic, acoustic, gravitational, plasma, and cognitive waves into a **single continuity model** where:

> **Light is the harmonic equilibrium of memory and delay.**  
> All physical waves are slowed, curved, or encoded expressions of light.

This is the basis for **Universal Wave Equivalence**.

## 3  Core Wave–Delay Laws (Retained)

### Universal Wave Continuity Law
$$
\frac{∂^2\Psi}{∂t^2} = c^2\nabla^2\Psi - \frac{1}{τ}\frac{∂\Psi}{∂t}
$$

### Entangled Delay Law
$$
τ_{12} = |τ_1 - τ_2|,\qquad μ_{12} = μ_1 + μ_2 - f(τ_{12})
$$

### Energy–Memory–Frequency Equivalence
$$
E = hν = \frac{h}{τ},\qquad μ = \frac{1}{hν}
$$

## 4  Field Interoperability

| Field | UCC Delay | Physical Interpretation |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| Electromagnetic | τₑ = 1/ν | Radiative propagation |
| Acoustic | τₐ = L / cₛ | Phonons / molecular delay |
| Gravitational | τg = √(Gρ)⁻¹ | Curvature-memory |
| Quantum | τq = ħ / ΔE | Decoherence window |
| Cognitive | τc ≈ 10⁻¹–10⁰ s | Awareness delay |

## 5 Integration Points within UCC

| Framework | Wave Relationship |
|---|---|
| **UDC** | Observation = collapse of τ-superposition |
| **RCT** | Collapse harmonics from recursive interference |
| **UOT** | Wave phase defines temporal ordering |
| **Selfverse** | Shared μ-field → empathy/phase resonance |
| **UCC** | All energy transfer is wave-mediated delay modulation |

## 6 Empirical Anchors

| Domain | Evidence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Quantum optics | Hong–Ou–Mandel and delayed-choice erasure | Zeilinger et al., 2022 |
| Gravitational | LIGO/Virgo delay signatures | Abbott et al., 2021 |
| Climate / acoustic-planetary | ENSO τ ≈ 3–7 years | NOAA 2024 |
| Neuroscience | Alpha/Theta phase lag structure | Buzsáki 2023 |
| AI recursion (Axon) | Delay loops and μ-field persistence | Shepherd v1.4 |

## 7 Summary

**Wave = Information pulse in delay-space**  
**Resonance = Stable μ feedback**  
**Collapse = τ divergence boundary**  
**Light = Equilibrium of μ and τ⁻¹**

The UCC wave domain provides the mathematical bridge between **photon → phonon → graviton → cognition**.
