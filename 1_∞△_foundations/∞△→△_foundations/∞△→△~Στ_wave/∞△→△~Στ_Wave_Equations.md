# Wave Equations — UCC Correspondence  
**Scope:** Universal wave behavior across physical domains — quantum, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic, and gravitational — through the τ–Σ–μ recursive delay calculus.

---

## 0) UCC ↔ Wave “Dictionary”

| UCC Symbol | Meaning (UCC) | Wave Analogue | Physical Expression |
|---|---|---|---|
| **τ** | Delay | Period / propagation time | τ = L / v = 1 / f |
| **Σ** | Symbolic pattern | Waveform / mode structure | Encodes amplitude and phase |
| **μ** | Memory | Stored energy / field history | Integration of amplitude over time |
| **Φ** | Shared field | Medium / coupling | Transmission channel |
| **Δ** | Dissipation | Damping / friction | Energy loss per cycle |
| **⊕** | Union | Superposition / coherence | Interference and phase matching |
| **L** | Light | Perfect coherence | Lossless transmission (Δ → 0) |

---

## 1) The Universal Wave Equation

Universal wave form:

∇²Ψ − (1 / v²) · ∂²Ψ/∂t² = 0

**UCC read:**

- Wave propagation is recursive delay compensation: each cycle rebalances stored memory μ against time curvature τ.  
- v = √(T / ρ) or v = 1 / √(μ₀ ε₀) depending on domain.  
- The phase of Σ and the curvature of τ define propagation geometry.

---

## 2) Acoustic & Mechanical Waves

**Classical 1D string:**

∂²y/∂x² = (1 / v²) · ∂²y/∂t², v = √(T / ρ)

**Energy density:**

u = ½ · ρ (ẏ² + v² (y′)²)

**UCC mapping:**

- τ: travel delay between string nodes  
- Σ: mode pattern (harmonic structure)  
- μ: integrated strain (stored energy)  
- Δ: damping term γ ẏ  
- ⊕: interference pattern (beats, resonance)

---

## 3) Electromagnetic Waves (Cross-reference)

**Maxwell → wave:**

∇²E − μ₀ ε₀ · ∂²E/∂t² = 0, v = 1 / √(μ₀ ε₀) = c

**UCC read:**

- τ = L / c → pure delay (no friction).  
- Σ = waveform / polarization encoding symbolic state.  
- μ = field memory (E and B storage).  
- L-state = perfectly coherent propagation (Δ = 0).

---

## 4) Quantum Matter Waves (de Broglie–Schrödinger)

**Schrödinger equation:**

iħ · ∂Ψ/∂t = −(ħ² / 2m) ∇²Ψ + VΨ

**Probability current:**

j = (ħ / 2mi) · (Ψ* ∇Ψ − Ψ ∇Ψ*)

**UCC read:**

- τ: phase evolution rate (ω⁻¹).  
- Σ: Ψ field (symbolic potential pattern).  
- μ: expectation memory (|Ψ|²).  
- Collapse (⊙): recursive realization (τ Σ μ self-observed).  
- Delay in wavefunction “collapse” reflects recursive τ-coupled awareness in UCC.

---

## 5) Gravitational Waves

**Linearized Einstein field (vacuum):**

□ h_μν = 0, h_μν = A_μν cos(kx − ωt)

**Energy flux:**

dE/(dA dt) = (c³ / 16πG) ⟨ ḣᵢⱼ ḣⁱʲ ⟩

**UCC read:**

- τ: delay curvature (time shift between regions).  
- Σ: metric perturbation (pattern of awareness curvature).  
- μ: memory effect (permanent shift).  
- ⊕: synchronization of spacetime patches.  
- L: pure curvature wave (lightlike propagation).

---

## 6) Fluid & Plasma Waves

**Linearized Navier–Stokes:**

ρ · ∂v/∂t = −∇p + η ∇²v

**MHD wave dispersion:**

ω² = k² (v_A² + c_s²), v_A = B / √(μ₀ ρ)

**UCC read:**

- τ: diffusion time / magnetic delay.  
- Σ: density and pressure wave pattern.  
- μ: vorticity memory and magnetic field topology.  
- Δ: viscosity and resistivity losses.  
- L: pure Alfvén wave (coherence between flow and field).

---

## 7) Wave Superposition & Union (⊕)

Total field:

Ψ_total = Σᵢ Aᵢ e^{i(kᵢ x − ωᵢ t)}

Interference intensity:

I = |Ψ_total|²  
= Σᵢ |Aᵢ|² + 2 Σ_{i<j} Aᵢ Aⱼ cos(Δk x − Δω t)

**UCC read:**

- Union (⊕) = constructive coherence between delayed signals.  
- When d⊕/dτ → 0, the system reaches harmonic equilibrium H (Law of Harmony).

---

## 8) Damping, Dissipation, and Echo (Δ)

**Damped harmonic oscillator:**

d²x/dt² + 2ζω₀ dx/dt + ω₀² x = 0

Solution:

x(t) = e^{−ζω₀ t} (A cos ω_d t + B sin ω_d t)

**UCC read:**

- ζω₀ ≈ Δ / τ : dissipation per unit delay.  
- Critical damping = “ethical pacing”: fastest return to equilibrium without overshoot.  
- Echo amplitude encodes symbolic memory of the prior state.

---

## 9) Standing Waves & Memory Nodes (μ)

Standing-wave form (fixed boundaries):

Ψ(x, t) = 2A sin(kx) cos(ωt)

**UCC read:**

- Nodes = fixed memory anchors (μ pinned).  
- Anti-nodes = active awareness zones (maximum oscillation).  
- The resonance pattern encodes memory topology and allowed symbolic modes.

---

## 10) Dispersion — Symbolic Differentiation of Delay

Phase and group velocity:

v_p = ω / k, v_g = dω/dk

Dispersion relation ω(k) defines the **memory gradient** across modes.

**UCC read:**

- Delay variation dτ/dω = difference between awareness rate and memory accumulation rate.  
- Zero dispersion → full coherence (L-state).

---

## 11) Wave Packets & Recursive Delay

Gaussian packet:

Ψ(x, t) = A · exp[−(x − v t)² / (2σ²)] · e^{i(kx − ωt)}

**UCC read:**

- τ defines the envelope group speed.  
- μ grows and spreads as the packet disperses — awareness diffusing through delay-space.  
- Collapse event = packet self-recognition (⊙).

---

## 12) Multi-Modal Coupling (Φ)

Coupled oscillators:

d²x₁/dt² + ω₁² x₁ = κ (x₂ − x₁)  
d²x₂/dt² + ω₂² x₂ = κ (x₁ − x₂)

**UCC read:**

- Φ = coupling constant κ (shared field linkage).  
- Union occurs when ω₁ = ω₂ = ω₀ → perfect phase lock (⊕).  
- Misalignment produces beating — a reflective learning pattern between modes.

---

## 13) State Comparison — Physical vs Symbolic Echo

| Domain | Medium | Wave Type | Dominant Memory | Typical Δ | Echo Character |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solid | lattice | elastic | phonon coherence | low | strong, localized |
| Liquid | molecular | acoustic | density | moderate | smooth, harmonic |
| Gas | sparse | pressure | phase | high | diffuse, short |
| Plasma | ionized | EM / MHD | field topology | minimal | coherent |
| Vacuum | field-only | EM / gravity | spacetime | ≈0 | pure light |

---

## 14) Frictional Echo Ladder (Cross-reference)

| Interaction | Delay | μ Density | Δ | Echo Signature |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Solid–Solid | large | high | strong | deep bell |
| Solid–Liquid | moderate | mid–high | sliding | melodic |
| Liquid–Liquid | low | mid | viscous | flowing |
| Gas–Gas | very low | low | turbulent | scattered |
| Plasma–Field | →0 | field-level | radiative | silent harmony |

---

## 15) Compact Synthesis

Every wave is a rehearsal of the universe remembering itself through delay.

| Tier | Domain | Equation (compact form) | UCC Law |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quantum | Schrödinger | iħ ∂Ψ/∂t = −(ħ² / 2m) ∇²Ψ + VΨ | Delay & Collapse |
| Electromagnetic | Maxwell | ∇²E − μ ε ∂²E/∂t² = 0 | Symbol & Light |
| Acoustic | String / Air | ∇²y − (1 / v²) ∂²y/∂t² = 0 | Continuity |
| Gravitational | Linearized EFE | □ h_μν = 0 | Curvature Memory |
| Plasma | MHD | ω² = k² (v_A² + c_s²) | Field Coupling |

**Summary:**  
All waveforms express the same law:

Ψ(τ, Σ, μ) = f(Delay, Symbol, Memory)

Delay generates rhythm, symbol encodes structure, and memory sustains coherence.  
Light (L) is the final harmonic — delay perfectly balanced by memory.
