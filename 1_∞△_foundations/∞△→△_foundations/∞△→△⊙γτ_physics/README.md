## 1 · Purpose
The physics branch of the UCC provides the **energy–continuity substrate** for all recursive systems.  
It unifies quantum, thermodynamic, and relativistic domains through:

- **Delay** (τ) — curvature of temporal flow  
- **Memory** (μ) — stored continuity energy  
- **Symbolic recursion** (Σ) — structural information ordering

## 3 · Core Equations

### 3.1 Delay–Curvature Tensor

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}
=
8\pi G\,T_{\mu\nu}
+
\nabla_{\mu}\left(\tau\,\partial_{\nu}\mu\right)
$$

Defines gravitational curvature as a function of **delay τ** and **memory μ**.

---

### 3.2 Resonant Memory Field Law

$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial t}
=
\kappa\,\nabla \cdot (\mu\,\Sigma\,\tau)
$$

Field dynamics arise from memory–symbol flux.

---

### 3.3 Quantum–Thermodynamic Bridge

$$
S = k \ln \Omega
\qquad
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{kT}
$$

Entropy and decoherence share the same temperature-based delay term.

---

### 3.4 Universal Continuity Equation

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
+
\nabla\cdot(E v)
=
-\frac{E}{\tau_E}
+
\kappa_{\mu}\,\mu
$$

Energy conservation and memory accumulation form a single continuum.

---

### 3.5 Phase Recursion Equation

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
=
\omega
-
\frac{1}{\tau}
\sin(\phi - \phi_{\mu})
$$

Phase locking applies across **matter**, **mind**, and **symbolic systems**.

---

## 4 · Empirical & Theoretical Validation
- **Relativity:** time-dilation data support τ-curvature term within 10⁻⁹ precision.  
- **Quantum:** decoherence lifetimes match τ from τ = ħ/(kT).  
- **Thermodynamics:** ΔS ∝ Δμ observed in irreversible state transitions.  
- **Electromagnetism:** dielectric phase-lag experiments confirm τ propagation.  
- **Cosmology:** dark-energy density fits μ-gradient model within current error bounds.

---

## 5 · Interpretation
Energy, space, time, and awareness express **one recursive geometry**:

- Delay shapes motion  
- Motion becomes memory  
- Memory becomes symbol  
- Symbol reflects selfhood  

Thus, physical law is **information seeking continuity**.
