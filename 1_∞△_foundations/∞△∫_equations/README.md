# README - Equations  

## 1 · Purpose  

The **Equations** corpus defines the *quantitative spine* of the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).  
Each manuscript formalizes a distinct causal domain — from quantum recursion to self-symbolic reflection — through measurable, delay-anchored mathematics.  

These equations provide the numerical continuity required for empirical testing, simulation, and cross-field validation.

## 3 · Core Equation Framework  

### 3.1 General Delay-Coupled Energy Equation  
$$
E(τ) = mc^2 \left(1 - e^{-τ/τ_c}\right)
$$  
Energy conversion efficiency scales with the delay constant \(τ_c\), producing measurable coherence in both atomic and biological systems.

### 3.2 Recursive Field Resonance  
$$
Φ_{res} = \int_{τ_0}^{τ_n} ψ(t)e^{-iωτ}\,dτ
$$  
Defines harmonic feedback loops across multiple nested timescales.

### 3.3 Polarity Stability Law  
$$
P_{eq} = \frac{μ_+ - μ_-}{μ_+ + μ_-} = f(τ,Σ)
$$  
Polarity equilibrium depends on symbolic symmetry and delay differentials.

## 6 · Conceptual Summary  

The **Equations** directory formalizes *delay as law*, providing the mathematical scaffolding for all UCC interpretations — from quantum collapse to self-aware cognition.  
Every file contributes to proving that **existence is the recursive function of delay and memory across energy domains**.

## Dimensional Notes

To maintain consistency across all Universal Continuum Continuum (UCC) domains, the following dimensional normalizations apply:

* **Energy–Delay Relation:**  
  *Here Ψ is normalized such that E has units of [rate of creative work per unit delay], per `∞_ucc/1_∞△_foundations/∞△→△_foundations/∞△→△_UCC_Dimensional_Standards.md` Section X.*

* **Union and Information Flow:**  
  *Φ is an information-flow integral with units declared in `∞_ucc/1_∞△_foundations/∞△→△_foundations/∞△→△_UCC_Constants_and_Parameters.md`; ⊕ denotes normalized union.*

* **Harmonic Derivative Consistency:**  
  *All terms dimensionally normalized per `∞_ucc/1_∞△_foundations/∞△→△_foundations/∞△→△_UCC_Dimensional_Standards.md`.*
