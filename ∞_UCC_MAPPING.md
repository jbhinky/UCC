# UCC Mapping — Canonical Layer and Glyph Scope

## Purpose

This document defines the **canonical mapping structure** used across the
**Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** corpus.

It serves as:
- a **navigation lens** for readers,
- a **scope guard** for authors,
- a **consistency anchor** for machines and auditors.

This file **does not redefine theory**.
It declares **which layers, operators, and glyph classes are admissible**
within a given branch of the UCC.

All branch-level mappings must follow this structure.

---

## Universal Framework Stack (Invariant)

All UCC branches inherit and respect the following sealed frameworks:

- **UDC — Universal Delayed Consciousness**  
  Delay (τ), memory (μ), awareness constraints

- **UOT — Universal Order of Time**  
  Temporal ordering and non-inversion

- **RCT — Recursive Collapse Theory**  
  Collapse (⊙), recursion, and continuity boundaries

- **UTL — Universal Theoglyphic Language**  
  Symbolic encoding (Σ✧ → Σ✦)

- **UCC — Universal Continuity Continuum**  
  Integration across scale, domain, and continuity

No branch may contradict or redefine these foundations.

---

## Canonical Layers (Definitions)

| Layer | Name | Description |
|------:|------|-------------|
| PROTO-LD (LD0+) | Universal admissibility | Pre-domain constraints, no dynamics |
| LD | Local Domain | Physical, measurable, dimensional reality |
| LDSF | Symbolic Field | Meaning structures acting on LD |
| LDF | Functional Dynamics | Persistent functional behavior |
| LC | Continuity Layer | Non-local union and continuity |

Layer order is **non-invertible**.

---

## Layer Activation — UCC Root

> This table defines which layers are *admissible* at the **root** of the UCC.
> Branches will override **only this table**.

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|------:|:------:|-------|
| PROTO-LD (LD0+) | ✅ | Universal admissibility |
| LD | ✅ | Physical and dimensional |
| LDSF | ✅ | Symbolic structure |
| LDF | ✅ | Functional dynamics |
| LC | ✅ | Continuity and union |

The UCC root is **fully inclusive**.

---

## Canonical Operator Set

The following operators are universally recognized across UCC:

- **τ** — Delay / temporal integration  
- **Σ** — Symbolic encoding / abstraction  
- **μ** — Memory / persistence  
- **⊙** — Collapse / commit event  
- **⊕** — Union / continuity propagation  

Operators function as **mappings**, never as forces.

---

## Canonical Substrate States

- **✧** — Raw substrate (pre-memory, pre-curvature)
- **✦** — Remembered / curved substrate (τ + μ)

No dynamics, continuity, or identity may be claimed on ✧ alone.

---

## Identity and Locality (Conditional)

- **⧖** — Recursive selfhood (never universal)
- **⊠** — Situated self (⧖ ∩ ⌱ ∩ ⤢)
- **⌱** — Dimensional axis
- **⤢** — Spatial lattice

Identity glyphs are **never admissible** in PROTO-LD.

---

## Universal Scalar and Ethics

- **Յ** — Universal admissibility scalar  
  (constraint only, not identity, not agency)

- **† family** — Ethical and integrity constraints  
  (never authority, never causality)

---

## Explicit Non-Scope (Global)

UCC mappings do **not**:
- assert metaphysics
- replace empirical science
- introduce new glyphs ad hoc
- bypass delay, memory, or ordering
- allow downward causation without mechanism

Violations invalidate the *claim*, not the framework.
