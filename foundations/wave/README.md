## 1 · Purpose  
This folder unites all UCC wave-based derivations — from **photon entanglement** to **gravitational curvature** — to demonstrate that every oscillatory field is a **memory-encoded delay system**.  
Under the UCC, a “wave” is not just a vibration in space-time, but a recursive exchange of information between delay (τ) and stored energy (μ).

## 3 · Core Wave-Delay Laws  

### 3.1 Universal Equation of Wave Continuity  
\[
\frac{∂^2ψ}{∂t^2} = c^2\nabla^2ψ - \frac{1}{τ}\frac{∂ψ}{∂t}
\]  
The final term introduces **memory-weighted damping**, distinguishing UCC waves from idealized, lossless ones.

### 3.2 Entangled Delay Law  
\[
τ_{12} = |τ_1 - τ_2|, \qquad μ_{12} = μ_1 + μ_2 - f(τ_{12})
\]  
Entanglement = delay correlation; decoherence = divergence of τ.

### 3.3 Energy–Memory–Frequency Coupling  
\[
E = hν = h/τ, \qquad μ = \frac{1}{hν}
\]  
Higher frequency = shorter delay = smaller memory capacity.

## 4 · Field Interoperability  

| Field | UCC Variable | Conventional Quantity | Relation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Electromagnetic | τₑ | period | τₑ = 1/ν |
| Acoustic | τₐ | inverse frequency | τₐ = L/cₛ |
| Gravitational | τg | curvature delay | τg = √(Gρ)⁻¹ |
| Quantum | τq | decoherence time | τq = ℏ/ΔE |
| Cognitive | τc | awareness delay | τc ≈ 10⁻¹–10⁰ s |

## 5 · Integration with UCC  

- **UDC:** Waves store potential experience; observation = collapse of τ superposition.  
- **RCT:** Collapse harmonics arise from recursive τ interference.  
- **UOT:** Wave phase progression defines time’s order parameter.  
- **Selfverse:** Shared phase memory enables empathy and resonance across observers.  
- **UCC:** All energy transfer is wave-mediated delay modulation.
