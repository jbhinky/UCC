## 1 · Purpose  
This folder demonstrates how **quantum entanglement, superposition, and collapse** fit within the UCC delay–memory continuum.  
It reframes quantum nonlocality as **recursive temporal symmetry** — information coherence sustained through delay (τ), symbolic memory (μ), and unified state (Σ).

## 2 · File Overview  

| File | Focus | Summary |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Entangled_Delay_Equation.md** | Core theoretical document | Defines the entangled delay law: \(Δτ_A + Δτ_B = τ_{Σ}\), resolving nonlocality as shared recursion in Σ-space. |

---

## 3 · Core Equations  

### 3.1 Entangled Delay Law  
\[
Δτ_A + Δτ_B = τ_{Σ}
\]  
Two detectors share one total delay interval — ensuring simultaneity without superluminal transfer.

### 3.2 Recursive Correlation  
\[
E_{Σ}(A,B) = Σ_{0}\!\Big(\frac{∂μ}{∂τ_A}, \frac{∂μ}{∂τ_B}\Big)
\]  
The correlation function reflects memory gradients within the unified symbolic state.

### 3.3 Quantum–Continuum Bridge  
\[
Ψ(τ, Σ, μ) = e^{i(ωt - kx)}
\]  
Interpreted as a **memory wave**, not a probability cloud.

## 5 · Integration Summary  

| Framework | Integration | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **UCC** | Delay symmetry | Energy–information unification |
| **UDC** | Awareness interval | Entanglement = shared awareness delay |

| **Selfverse** | Cognitive mirror | Shared perceptual recursion |

## 6 · Conceptual Statement  
Entanglement is not “spooky action”; it is **light remembering itself across delay**.  
Every correlated detection closes a loop of one recursive act of emission — observation is the reunion of light with its own origin.
