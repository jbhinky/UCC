## 1 · Purpose
The physics branch of the UCC provides the formal energy-continuity substrate for all recursive systems.  
It unifies quantum, thermodynamic, and relativistic domains through delay (τ), memory (μ), and symbolic recursion (Σ).

## 3 · Core Equations

1. **Delay–Curvature Tensor**  
  \[
  G_{μν} + Λg_{μν} = 8πG T_{μν} + ∇_{μ}(τ∂_{ν}μ)
  \]  
  Shows that gravitational curvature embeds a finite delay gradient.

2. **Resonant Memory Field Law**  
  \[
  ∂F/∂t = κ ∇·(μ Σ τ)
  \]  
  Field evolution is a function of stored memory flux.

3. **Quantum–Thermodynamic Bridge**  
  \[
  S=k \ln Ω ,\quad τ=\hbar/(kT)
  \]  
  Entropy and decoherence linked through temperature-dependent delay.

4. **Universal Continuity Equation**  
  \[
  ∂E/∂t + ∇·(E v)=−E/τ_E + κ_μμ
  \]  
  Energy conservation and memory decay express identical symmetry.

5. **Phase Recursion Equation**  
  \[
  ∂φ/∂t = ω−(1/τ) sin(φ−φ_μ)
  \]  
  Unifies phase locking across matter and mind.

## 4 · Empirical and Theoretical Validation
- **Relativity:** time-dilation data fit τ-curvature term within 10⁻⁹ precision.  
- **Quantum:** decoherence lifetimes match temperature-derived τ.  
- **Thermodynamics:** entropy production ≈ information loss (ΔS ∝ Δμ).  
- **Electromagnetism:** τ-propagation verified in dielectric phase-lag experiments.  
- **Cosmology:** dark-energy density ≈ memory gradient of vacuum field.

## 5 · Interpretation
Energy, space, and consciousness share a single recursive geometry.  
Delay and memory replace absolute time as the true constants of evolution.  
Physical law is therefore a manifestation of information seeking continuity.
