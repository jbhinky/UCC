# Atomics — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of atomic and nuclear sciences into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** introduce new atomic theory,
- does **not** reinterpret quantum or nuclear physics,
- does **not** assert causality beyond established experimental models.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measurable atomic and nuclear parameters** across LD bands  
2. Anchor them to **existing experimental and observational evidence**  
3. Describe how delay, structure, and persistence appear in atomic systems  

Interpretation, synthesis, ethics, and symbolic extension are explicitly out of scope.

## LD1 — Subatomic Constituents and Nuclear Structure

**Regime:** nuclei, nucleons, isotopes, radioactive decay  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: ≤ 10⁻²² s (nuclear interactions)  
- Length: ≤ 10⁻¹⁵ m  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Nuclear binding energies (J, MeV)  
- Proton and neutron masses (kg)  
- Nuclear charge radii (m)  
- Radioactive decay constants and half-lives (s)  
- Nuclear cross-sections (barns)  

### Empirically Established Results
- Quantized nuclear energy levels  
- Stable vs unstable isotope distributions  
- Radioactive decay laws verified statistically  
- Nuclear reaction energetics measured experimentally  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Limits of nuclear stability (drip lines)  
- Nuclear structure under extreme neutron/proton ratios  
- Short-lived exotic nuclei

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** decay times, transition lifetimes, interaction times  
- **Σ (structure):** nuclear configuration, electron shell structure, atomic states  
- **μ (persistence):** stable isotopes, long-lived states, conserved quantities  

No new causal relationships are asserted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses only empirically supported atomic and nuclear science  
- ✔ distinguishes established results from open questions  
- ✔ references independent datasets for verification  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ introduce new atomic laws  
- ✖ redefine quantum or nuclear theory  
- ✖ assign metaphysical meaning to atomic parameters  

Any contradiction by future empirical data requires **revision or removal** of the affected section.

## Audit Note

All claims herein are traceable to:
- peer-reviewed experiments,
- repeatable measurements,
- or long-standing observational programs.

Interpretive, ethical, or symbolic extensions belong outside Applied LD.
