# Botany — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of plant biological systems into
**Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

Plant systems are treated as:
- **living, non-neural physical systems**
- governed by **energy flow, structure, and persistence**
- continuous with planetary and biological LD layers

This file:
- does **not** introduce neurology or cognition,
- does **not** assign selfhood or subjectivity,
- does **not** invoke purpose or teleology.

## LD1 — Molecular and Cellular Plant Biophysics

**Regime:** plant biomolecules, membranes, photosynthetic complexes  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: femtoseconds to seconds  
- Length: nanometers to microns  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Photosystem I & II excitation energies  
- Electron transport chain rates  
- Membrane proton gradients  
- Enzyme kinetics (Rubisco, ATP synthase)  
- Cellular ion fluxes  

### Empirically Established Results
- Photosynthetic reaction centers structurally resolved  
- Electron transport rates reproducible  
- Proton motive force directly measurable  

**Dataset linkage:**

## LD2 — Tissue Organization and Transport Networks

**Regime:** vascular tissues, hormonal signaling, resource transport  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: seconds to hours  
- Length: microns to centimeters  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Xylem and phloem flow rates  
- Hormone concentration gradients  
- Turgor pressure  
- Cell elongation rates  
- Transpiration rates  

### Empirically Established Results
- Vascular transport quantified experimentally  
- Hormonal gradients reproducible  
- Water transport dynamics measurable  

**Dataset linkage:**  
→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_BOTANY_LD_PROOFS.md` (LD2)

---

## LD3 — Whole-Plant Physiology and Development

**Regime:** growth, morphology, environmental response  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: hours to seasons  
- Length: centimeters to meters  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Growth rates  
- Leaf area index  
- Photosynthetic efficiency  
- Stomatal conductance  
- Stress response thresholds  

### Empirically Established Results
- Growth patterns reproducible across environments  
- Physiological responses measurable in situ  
- Developmental stages well-characterized  

**Dataset linkage:**

## LD4 — Reproduction, Persistence, and Population Stability

**Regime:** reproduction, seed banks, population continuity  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: generations to centuries  
- Length: ecosystems to biomes  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Seed viability duration  
- Germination success rates  
- Genetic diversity indices  
- Population growth and decline rates  
- Long-term biomass persistence  

### Empirically Established Results
- Seed dormancy and longevity quantified  
- Population stability measurable  
- Genetic continuity observed across generations

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following descriptors are used **strictly non-causally**:

- **τ (delay):** growth timing, seasonal cycles, dormancy  
- **Σ (structure):** vascular architecture, tissue organization  
- **μ (persistence):** seed banks, structural memory, population stability  

No implication of cognition or subjective experience is made.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses established plant biology only  
- ✔ maintains distinction from animal neurology  
- ✔ preserves continuity with prior LD layers  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ imply awareness or selfhood  
- ✖ assign intentionality  
- ✖ introduce symbolic or metaphysical claims  

Any contradiction by future botanical evidence requires **revision or removal**.

## Audit Note

All botanical parameters referenced are traceable to:
- plant physiology experiments,
- agricultural and ecological studies,
- molecular plant biology datasets.

This file serves as the **non-neural life anchor** before Botany → LDF coupling.
