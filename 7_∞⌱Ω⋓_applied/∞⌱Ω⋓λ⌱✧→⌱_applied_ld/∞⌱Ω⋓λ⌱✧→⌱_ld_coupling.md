# Planetary LD Coupling — Applied

## Purpose and Scope

This document defines **how non-biological Living Dimension (LD) systems exchange energy, momentum, and matter** across planetary domains.

It exists to:
1. Demonstrate that **LD domains are physically coupled**, not isolated
2. Establish **planetary continuity** prior to biological emergence
3. Prevent the treatment of life as “special physics”
4. Provide a **causal substrate** for the LD → LDF transition

This file introduces **no biological processes** and **no normative interpretation**.

---

## Coupling Principles (Non-Interpretive)

All planetary coupling occurs through:
- **Energy flux**
- **Mass transport**
- **Momentum transfer**
- **Time-delayed persistence**

These interactions are empirically measurable and domain-independent.

---

## 1. Atmosphere ↔ Ocean Coupling

### Exchange Mechanisms
- Sensible heat flux
- Latent heat flux (phase change)
- Momentum transfer via wind stress
- Gas exchange at the air–sea interface

### Empirically Measurable Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Range | Units | Measurement Method |
|---------|---------------|-------|--------------------|
| Sensible heat flux | −200 to +200 | W·m⁻² | Flux towers |
| Latent heat flux | 0–300 | W·m⁻² | Bulk formulas |
| Wind stress | 0–2 | N·m⁻² | Scatterometry |
| Gas exchange rate | variable | mol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ | Tracer studies |

### Continuity Role
- **τ:** delayed thermal equilibration  
- **Σ:** stratified boundary layers  
- **μ:** ocean heat storage  

---

## 2. Ocean ↔ Geology Coupling

### Exchange Mechanisms
- Heat transfer at the seafloor
- Chemical exchange via hydrothermal systems
- Sediment deposition and subduction
- Mechanical interaction at plate boundaries

### Empirically Measurable Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Range | Units | Measurement Method |
|---------|---------------|-------|--------------------|
| Geothermal heat flux | 20–300 | mW·m⁻² | Borehole probes |
| Hydrothermal flow | site-dependent | kg·s⁻¹ | Vent surveys |
| Sedimentation rate | mm–cm·yr⁻¹ | length·time⁻¹ | Core analysis |
| Crustal heat loss | variable | W | Integrated surveys |

### Continuity Role
- **τ:** slow thermal diffusion  
- **Σ:** crust–mantle architecture  
- **μ:** long-term geochemical memory  

---

## 3. Atmosphere ↔ Geology Coupling

### Exchange Mechanisms
- Volcanic gas emission
- Aerosol injection
- Chemical weathering
- Dust and particulate transport

### Empirically Measurable Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Range | Units | Measurement Method |
|---------|---------------|-------|--------------------|
| Volcanic gas flux | variable | kg·s⁻¹ | Remote sensing |
| Aerosol loading | 0–5+ | optical depth | Satellites |
| Weathering rates | basin-dependent | mol·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | Field studies |
| Dust transport | 10⁶–10⁹ | kg·yr⁻¹ | Observations |

### Continuity Role
- **τ:** delayed atmospheric response  
- **Σ:** topographic forcing  
- **μ:** surface composition persistence  

---

## 4. Planetary Energy Budget (Non-Biological)

### Core Components
- Solar radiative input
- Planetary albedo
- Longwave radiative emission
- Internal geothermal contribution

### Empirically Measurable Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Value | Units | Measurement Method |
|---------|---------------|-------|--------------------|
| Solar constant | ~1,361 | W·m⁻² | Satellite |
| Planetary albedo | ~0.3 | dimensionless | Radiometry |
| Outgoing longwave radiation | ~240 | W·m⁻² | Satellites |
| Internal heat flux | ~0.08 | W·m⁻² | Geophysical |

### Continuity Role
- **τ:** thermal inertia  
- **Σ:** radiative balance structure  
- **μ:** energy storage reservoirs  

---

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** response times, equilibration lags, diffusion scales  
- **Σ (structure):** layered fluids, solid boundaries, circulation geometry  
- **μ (persistence):** heat reservoirs, compositional memory  

No symbolic, ethical, or biological meaning is assigned.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ establishes physical continuity across LD domains
- ✔ relies solely on measured planetary processes
- ✔ introduces no new physical theory

This document does **not**:
- ✖ include biology or ecology
- ✖ infer purpose or directionality
- ✖ introduce climate attribution or ethics

Any contradiction by future measurements requires **revision or removal**.

---

## Audit Note

All coupling mechanisms described are supported by:
- satellite observation programs,
- laboratory measurements,
- field surveys,
- and long-running geophysical datasets.

This file serves as the **final inert-system gate** before biological emergence.
