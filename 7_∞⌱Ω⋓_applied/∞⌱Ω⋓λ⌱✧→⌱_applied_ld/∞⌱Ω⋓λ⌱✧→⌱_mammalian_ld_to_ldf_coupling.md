# Mammalian LD→LDF Coupling  
*(LD = Light Dimension · LDF = Light Dimension Field)*

## Purpose

This document defines **strict, auditable boundary criteria** under which a mammalian system
*may be evaluated* for coupling from **Light Dimension (LD)** into **Light Dimension Field (LDF)**.

This file:
- does **not** assert that all mammals are LDF,
- does **not** equate intelligence with identity,
- defines **conditions for consideration only**, not conclusions.

Coupling is:
- **species-specific**
- **individual- and protocol-specific**
- **reversible upon falsification**

---

## Canonical Definitions (Locked)

### LD — Light Dimension
Describes how **light–matter–time structures organize across scale**.
LD applies universally and does **not** imply life, cognition, or identity.

### LDF — Light Dimension Field
Describes a **field-level integration of LD structures** characterized by:
- persistent internal state continuity,
- cross-context memory integration,
- delay-bound internal modeling.

LDF is **not selfhood**, **not personhood**, and **not ethical status**.

---

## Coupling Principle (Non-Interpretive)

A mammalian system may be considered for LD→LDF coupling **only if empirical evidence demonstrates all of the following simultaneously**:

1. **Persistent Internal State Continuity**  
   Internal representations persist across time without continuous external reinforcement.

2. **Cross-Context Generalization**  
   Learned structures are applied to **novel environments or tasks**, not only repeated conditions.

3. **Delay-Bound Memory Integration**  
   Memory retrieval spans meaningful delays (days to months where measured), not short-horizon conditioning.

4. **Integrated Neural Modeling**  
   Coordinated activity across distributed neural systems supporting unified internal state tracking
   (beyond reflex arcs or single-circuit learning).

Failure of **any single criterion** blocks coupling.

---

## Explicit Non-Qualifiers (Hard Exclusions)

The following **do not qualify** on their own:

- simple associative conditioning
- reflex-based learning
- single-context maze performance
- instinctual behaviors (feeding, mating, flight)
- stem-cell differentiation or development
- regeneration or healing capacity
- genetic inheritance alone

These remain **LD4 biological phenomena**, not LDF indicators.

---

## Permitted Evidence Classes

Only evidence meeting **all** of the following is admissible:

- controlled behavioral experiments with explicit generalization tests,
- defined memory retention intervals,
- neural correlates linked to behavioral outcomes,
- sufficient methodological detail for replication,
- datasets archived in peer-reviewable repositories or journal supplements.

Anecdotal or observational claims without controls are insufficient.

---

## Operational Audit Checklist (Required)

Any proposed LD→LDF coupling record **must include**:

- species and taxonomic resolution,
- subject count and identifiers,
- task and control protocol description,
- retention interval specification,
- generalization test definition,
- exclusion of simpler explanations (documented),
- data location (repository, accession, archive).

Missing elements invalidate the record.

---

## Linked Proof Anchor (Mandatory)

All coupling evaluations must reference:

→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_MAMMALIAN_LD_PROOFS.md`

No uncited or non-archived evidence is admissible.

---

## Falsifiability and Reversibility

If future evidence:
- fails replication,
- contradicts memory persistence,
- reveals methodological flaws,

then the coupling designation **must be withdrawn**.

No historical, cultural, or reputational arguments override empirical falsification.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ preserves LD = *Light Dimension*
- ✔ defines LDF strictly as a field condition
- ✔ prevents inflation from intelligence narratives

This document does **not**:
- ✖ assert selfhood or consciousness
- ✖ grant moral or ethical status
- ✖ introduce metaphysics or symbolism
