# Oceanology — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of oceanographic sciences into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** interpret ocean systems biologically,
- does **not** introduce climate theory,
- does **not** extend into ecological or ethical domains.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measurable physical and chemical ocean parameters**  
2. Anchor them to **independent observational datasets**  
3. Describe how delay, structure, and persistence manifest in planetary fluid systems

## LD1 — Molecular and Thermodynamic Properties of Seawater

**Regime:** molecular-scale and thermodynamic ocean properties  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: femtoseconds to seconds  
- Length: molecular to millimeters  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Salinity (PSU)  
- Density  
- Thermal expansion coefficient  
- Heat capacity  
- Molecular diffusion coefficients  

### Empirically Established Results
- Equation of state for seawater validated experimentally  
- Salinity–density–temperature relationships reproducible  
- Heat storage capacity of oceans quantified  

**Dataset linkage:**

## LD2 — Stratification, Mixing, and Chemical Gradients

**Regime:** vertical and horizontal water-column structure  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: minutes to years  
- Length: meters to kilometers  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Thermocline depth  
- Halocline depth  
- Buoyancy frequency  
- Dissolved oxygen

### Empirically Established Results
- Stable stratification patterns observed globally  
- Mixing rates measured via tracers  
- Chemical gradients persistent across time

## LD3 — Ocean Circulation and Basin-Scale Dynamics

**Regime:** currents, gyres, overturning circulation  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: months to centuries  
- Length: basin to global  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Current velocities  
- Sea surface height anomalies  
- Heat transport rates  
- Salinity transport  
- Eddy kinetic energy  

### Empirically Established Results
- Global circulation patterns mapped  
- Thermohaline circulation observed and constrained  
- Energy transport quantified

## LD4 — Long-Term Ocean Persistence and Planetary Regulation

**Regime:** long-timescale ocean behavior and planetary coupling  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: centuries to geological timescales  
- Length: global  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Ocean heat content trends  
- Long-term salinity shifts  
- Deep-ocean ventilation times  
- Carbon uptake rates (physical chemistry only)  

### Empirically Established Results
- Oceans as dominant planetary heat reservoir  
- Multi-century memory effects documented  
- Long-term chemical buffering observed

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

- **τ (delay):** mixing times, circulation turnover, heat uptake  
- **Σ (structure):** stratification, current geometry  
- **μ (persistence):** long-lived heat and salinity memory
