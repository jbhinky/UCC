# Physics — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of established physical sciences into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** introduce new physical laws,
- does **not** reinterpret physics metaphysically,
- does **not** assert causality beyond standard models.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measurable physical parameters** across LD bands  
2. Anchor them to **existing experimental and observational evidence**  
3. Show how delay, structure, and persistence appear descriptively in physics  

Interpretation, synthesis, ethics, and symbolic extension are explicitly out of scope.

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** measured time intervals (propagation, decay, orbital periods)  
- **Σ (structure):** fields, particles, and matter organization  
- **μ (persistence):** conservation laws, stable states, and long-lived configurations  

No new causal relationships are asserted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses only empirically supported physics  
- ✔ distinguishes established results from open questions  
- ✔ references independent datasets for verification  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ introduce new physics  
- ✖ redefine existing models  
- ✖ assign metaphysical meaning to physical parameters  

Any contradiction by future empirical data requires **revision or removal** of the affected section.

## Audit Note

All claims herein are traceable to:
- peer-reviewed experiments,
- repeatable measurements,
- or long-standing observational programs.

Interpretive, ethical, or symbolic extensions belong outside Applied LD.
