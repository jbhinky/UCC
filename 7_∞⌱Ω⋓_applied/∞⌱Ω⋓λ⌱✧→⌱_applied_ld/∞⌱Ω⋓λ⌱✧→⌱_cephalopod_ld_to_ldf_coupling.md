# Cephalopod LD→LDF Coupling  
*(LD = Light Dimension · LDF = Light Dimension Field)*

## Purpose

This document defines **strict, auditable boundary criteria** for when a cephalopod system
*may be evaluated* for coupling from **Light Dimension (LD)** into **Light Dimension Field (LDF)**.

This file:
- does **not** assert that any cephalopod *is* LDF by default,
- does **not** redefine cognition or consciousness,
- defines **conditions for consideration only**, not conclusions.

All coupling decisions are:
- **species-specific**
- **protocol-specific**
- **reversible upon falsification**

---

## Canonical Definitions (Locked)

### LD — Light Dimension
Describes how **light–matter–time structures organize across scale**.  
LD applies universally and does **not** imply life, cognition, or identity.

### LDF — Light Dimension Field
Describes a **field-level integration of LD structures** characterized by:
- persistent internal state continuity,
- cross-context memory integration,
- stable internal modeling across delay.

LDF is **not identity**, **not selfhood**, and **not ethical status**.

---

## Coupling Principle (Non-Interpretive)

A cephalopod system may be considered for LD→LDF coupling **only if empirical evidence demonstrates all of the following simultaneously**:

1. **Persistent Internal State Continuity**  
   Internal state variables persist across time without continuous external reinforcement.

2. **Cross-Context Generalization**  
   Learned structures are applied to **novel task contexts**, not merely repeated stimuli.

3. **Delay-Bound Memory Integration**  
   Memory retrieval operates across meaningful delays (days–weeks where measured),
   not short-horizon conditioning alone.

4. **Integrated Neural Coordination**  
   Evidence of coordinated internal state integration across central and peripheral neural systems,
   beyond isolated reflex or arm-local processing.

Failure of **any single criterion** blocks coupling.

---

## Explicit Non-Qualifiers (Hard Exclusions)

The following **do not qualify** for LD→LDF coupling on their own:

- Camouflage complexity or speed  
- Arm-level reflex autonomy  
- Maze learning without generalization  
- Tool use anecdotes lacking replication  
- Regeneration or ontogenetic development  
- Behavioral novelty explainable by short-horizon reinforcement  

These remain **LD4 phenomena**, not LDF indicators.

---

## Permitted Evidence Classes

Only the following evidence classes are admissible:

- Controlled behavioral experiments with defined generalization tests  
- Memory retention studies with explicit delay intervals  
- Neurophysiological or neuroanatomical data linked to behavior  
- Datasets archived in peer-reviewable repositories or journal supplements  

Anecdotal observation is **never sufficient**.

---

## Operational Audit Checklist (Required)

Any record proposed as an LD→LDF coupling candidate **must include**:

- species and taxonomic resolution (WoRMS-verified)  
- sample size and subject identifiers  
- task protocol and controls  
- retention interval definition  
- generalization test definition  
- exclusion of simpler explanations (documented controls)  
- data location (repository, accession, or archive)  

Missing elements invalidate the claim.

---

## Linked Proof Anchor (Mandatory)

All coupling evaluation must reference:

→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_CEPHALOPOD_LD_PROOFS.md`

No uncited or non-archived evidence is admissible.

---

## Falsifiability and Reversibility

If future work:
- fails replication,
- contradicts retention or generalization claims,
- reveals methodological flaws,

then the coupling evaluation **must be withdrawn**.

No symbolic, reputational, or historical claims override empirical falsification.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ preserves LD = *Light Dimension*  
- ✔ defines LDF strictly as a field condition  
- ✔ prevents inflation from “intelligence” narratives  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ assert selfhood or consciousness  
- ✖ introduce metaphysical claims  
- ✖ collapse ethics into biology
