# Cosmology — Applied LD (Observational Only)

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly observational mapping** of cosmological measurements into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** present cosmological origin narratives,
- does **not** privilege or replace ΛCDM or any competing model,
- does **not** infer causality beyond directly observed quantities.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measured cosmological parameters** across LD bands  
2. Anchor them to **independent observational datasets**  
3. Describe how delay, structure, and persistence appear at the largest observable scales  

All interpretation, model selection, and theory comparison are explicitly out of scope.

## LD1 — Early-Universe Observables (Measured, Not Interpreted)

**Regime:** radiation-dominated observables and particle-era constraints  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: seconds to hundreds of thousands of years (inferred from observation)  
- Length: horizon-scale at recombination  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature  
- CMB angular anisotropy spectra  
- Light element abundance ratios (H, He, Li)  
- Neutrino background constraints (observational limits)

### Empirically Established Results
- Uniform CMB temperature with small anisotropies  
- Elemental abundance ratios consistent across observations  
- Independent confirmation across satellite missions  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Improved precision in primordial abundance measurements  
- Constraints on relativistic species via observation

## LD2 — Expansion History (Observational Parameters)

**Regime:** large-scale expansion observables  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: millions to billions of years  
- Length: megaparsecs  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Redshift (z)  
- Luminosity distance  
- Angular diameter distance  
- Expansion rate measurements (H₀ ranges)  
- Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scales  

### Empirically Established Results
- Systematic redshift–distance relationships  
- Independent expansion measurements using different probes  
- BAO signatures observed in galaxy surveys  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Tension between independent expansion measurements  
- Improved distance ladder calibration

## LD3 — Large-Scale Structure and Matter Distribution

**Regime:** galaxy clustering and mass distribution  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: billions of years  
- Length: tens to hundreds of megaparsecs  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Galaxy correlation functions  
- Matter power spectra (observationally inferred)  
- Weak and strong gravitational lensing observables  
- Cluster mass distributions  

### Empirically Established Results
- Reproducible large-scale clustering patterns  
- Lensing-derived mass maps independent of luminosity  
- Statistical isotropy and homogeneity at large scales  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Small-scale deviations in structure formation  
- Improved mass mapping resolution

## LD4 — Cosmic Time Persistence and Horizon-Scale Phenomena

**Regime:** horizon-scale observables and long-term persistence  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: cosmic age  
- Length: observable universe  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Cosmic age estimates  
- Horizon distance  
- Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect (observational signal)  
- Gravitational lensing time delays at cosmological scales  

### Empirically Established Results
- Consistent cosmic age estimates across probes  
- Horizon-scale anisotropy constraints  
- Time-delay measurements confirming large-scale curvature effects  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Precision improvement in horizon measurements  
- Long-baseline lensing observations

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** light-travel time, expansion timescales, horizon limits  
- **Σ (structure):** large-scale clustering, anisotropy patterns  
- **μ (persistence):** long-lived statistical regularities across cosmic time  

No causal claims are introduced.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses only observational cosmology  
- ✔ separates measurement from theoretical explanation  
- ✔ aligns with independently verifiable datasets  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ explain the origin of the universe  
- ✖ argue for or against dark matter or dark energy models  
- ✖ extend symbolic or metaphysical claims  

Any contradiction by future observation requires **revision or removal** of the affected section.

---

## Audit Note

All claims herein are traceable to:
- satellite missions,
- redshift surveys,
- gravitational lensing programs,
- and long-term cosmological observation archives.

Interpretive or theoretical conclusions belong outside Applied LD.
