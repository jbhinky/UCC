# Chemistry — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of established chemistry into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** introduce new chemistry,
- does **not** reinterpret chemistry metaphysically,
- does **not** assert causality beyond standard chemical theory and measurement.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measurable chemical parameters** across LD bands  
2. Anchor them to **existing experimental and observational evidence**  
3. Describe how delay, structure, and persistence appear in chemical systems  

Interpretation, synthesis, ethics, and symbolic extension are explicitly out of scope.

## LD1 — Electronic Structure Primitives (Chemical Preconditions)

**Regime:** electron behavior underlying bonding (quantum-mechanical preconditions for chemistry)  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: ≤ 10⁻¹⁵ s  
- Length: ≤ 10⁻¹⁰ m  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Ionization energies (J, eV)  
- Electron affinities (J, eV)  
- Fundamental spectroscopic transitions (Hz)  
- Fine-structure splitting (Hz)  
- Electron scattering cross-sections (m²)

### Empirically Established Results
- Quantized electronic energy levels  
- Selection rules validated via spectroscopy  
- Electronic structure predictions validated against measured spectra (within known limits)

### Open and Testable Domains
- Electronic structure under extreme fields and ultrafast excitation  
- Boundary of classical-to-quantum approximations in complex systems

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** reaction timescales, diffusion times, equilibration and relaxation times  
- **Σ (structure):** bonding topology, molecular geometry, phase structure, interfaces  
- **μ (persistence):** stable products, conserved quantities, metastable phases, retained composition signatures  

No new causal relationships are asserted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses only empirically supported chemistry  
- ✔ distinguishes established results from open questions  
- ✔ references independent datasets for verification  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ introduce new chemical laws  
- ✖ redefine established chemical theory  
- ✖ assign metaphysical meaning to chemical parameters  

Any contradiction by future empirical data requires **revision or removal** of the affected section.

## Audit Note

All claims herein are traceable to:
- peer-reviewed experiments,
- repeatable measurements,
- or long-standing observational programs.

Interpretive, ethical, or symbolic extensions belong outside Applied LD.
