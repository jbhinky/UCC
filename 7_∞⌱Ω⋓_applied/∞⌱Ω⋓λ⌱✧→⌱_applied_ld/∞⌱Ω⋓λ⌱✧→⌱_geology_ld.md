# Geology — Applied LD

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a **strictly empirical mapping** of geological sciences into **Living Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

This file:
- does **not** reinterpret geological data philosophically,
- does **not** introduce new geodynamic theories,
- does **not** extend beyond established observational and experimental evidence.

Its sole purpose is to:
1. Identify **measurable geological parameters** across LD bands  
2. Anchor them to **independent geophysical, geochemical, and observational datasets**  
3. Describe how delay, structure, and persistence manifest in planetary solid systems  

Interpretation, synthesis, ethics, and symbolism are explicitly out of scope.

## LD1 — Mineral Physics and Atomic Lattice Structure

**Regime:** crystalline solids, mineral lattices, atomic bonding in Earth materials  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: femtoseconds to seconds  
- Length: ångströms to nanometers  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Crystal lattice parameters  
- Elastic moduli (bulk, shear)  
- Thermal expansion coefficients  
- Seismic wave velocities (P, S) at mineral scale  
- Phase stability fields (P–T)

### Empirically Established Results
- Crystal structures validated by X-ray and neutron diffraction  
- Mineral elasticity measured under pressure and temperature  
- Laboratory reproduction of mantle mineral phases  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Mineral behavior at extreme lower-mantle pressures  
- High-temperature phase transitions

## LD2 — Rock Formation, Phase Transitions, and Deformation

**Regime:** igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic processes  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: seconds to millions of years  
- Length: millimeters to kilometers  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Rock composition and mineral assemblages  
- Melting temperatures and solidus/liquidus curves  
- Stress–strain relationships  
- Fracture toughness  
- Metamorphic grade indicators  

### Empirically Established Results
- Rock cycle processes validated through field observation  
- Metamorphic facies mapped to pressure–temperature paths  
- Laboratory rock deformation experiments  

### Open and Testable Domains

## LD3 — Crustal Dynamics and Surface Processes

**Regime:** tectonics, volcanism, erosion, sediment transport  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: years to hundreds of millions of years  
- Length: meters to continental scales  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Plate velocities (cm·yr⁻¹)  
- Earthquake magnitudes and recurrence intervals  
- Volcanic eruption volumes and frequencies  
- Erosion and sedimentation rates  
- Heat flow measurements  

### Empirically Established Results
- Plate tectonics validated by GPS and seafloor mapping  
- Seismic hazard distributions mapped globally  
- Volcanic systems monitored in real time  

### Open and Testable Domains

## LD4 — Planetary Differentiation and Geological Time Persistence

**Regime:** planetary interiors, mantle convection, long-term evolution  
**Characteristic scales:**  
- Time: millions to billions of years  
- Length: planetary  

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Radiometric age determinations  
- Mantle convection velocities (inferred)  
- Core–mantle boundary properties  
- Planetary gravity and magnetic field data  
- Crustal thickness distributions  

### Empirically Established Results
- Geological timescales constrained by radiometric dating  
- Differentiation of core, mantle, and crust observed across planets  
- Long-term thermal evolution models constrained by observation  

### Open and Testable Domains
- Early planetary differentiation processes  
- Coupling between mantle dynamics and surface geology

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

The following terms are used **descriptively only**:

- **τ (delay):** geological timescales, strain accumulation, thermal diffusion  
- **Σ (structure):** mineral lattices, rock fabrics, tectonic architecture  
- **μ (persistence):** stable cratons, mineral records, stratigraphic continuity  

No new causal relationships are asserted.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ uses only established geological science  
- ✔ distinguishes observations from inference  
- ✔ references independently verifiable datasets  

This document does **not**:
- ✖ redefine geophysical theory  
- ✖ infer purpose or directionality  
- ✖ extend symbolic or metaphysical claims  

Any contradiction by future geological evidence requires **revision or removal**.

---

## Audit Note

All claims herein are traceable to:
- laboratory mineral physics experiments,
- field geology and geophysical surveys,
- satellite and seismic observation networks.

Interpretive or ethical extensions belong outside Applied LD.
