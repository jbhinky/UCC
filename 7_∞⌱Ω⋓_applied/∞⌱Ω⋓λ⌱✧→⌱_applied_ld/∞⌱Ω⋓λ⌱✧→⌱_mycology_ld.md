# Mycology — Applied LD (Light Dimension)

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides a strictly empirical mapping of fungal systems into
**Light Dimension (LD) bands LD1–LD4** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

**LD (Light Dimension)** describes how light–matter–time structures organize across scale.
LD classification does not imply selfhood, identity, ethics, or metaphysics.

Fungi are treated here as:
- eukaryotic organisms with filamentous or unicellular growth forms,
- biochemically regulated development and reproduction,
- ecological persistence through symbiosis, decomposition, and dispersal.

This file:
- does **not** assert selfhood or identity,
- does **not** assert LDF conditions,
- does **not** introduce symbolic or ethical interpretation.

---

## LD1 — Molecular and Cellular Light–Matter Organization

**Regime:** DNA/RNA, protein synthesis, membrane transport, enzymatic metabolism  
**Characteristic scales:** femtoseconds → seconds; nanometers → microns

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Gene and transcript abundance (counts/TPM)
- Enzyme kinetics (kcat, Km)
- Membrane transport rates (ion and nutrient transport)
- Mitochondrial respiration measures
- Stress signaling markers (oxidative, osmotic, thermal)

**Dataset linkage:**  
→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_MYCOLOGY_LD_PROOFS.md` (LD1)

---

## LD2 — Growth Form, Tissue-Level Organization, and Functional Systems

**Regime:** hyphal growth, branching dynamics, mycelial network formation, cell wall mechanics  
**Characteristic scales:** milliseconds → days; microns → meters (network scale)

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Hyphal extension rate (μm·s⁻¹ / mm·day⁻¹)
- Branch frequency and branching angles
- Mycelial density and biomass accumulation
- Nutrient uptake rate and translocation
- Mechanical properties of hyphae and cell walls

**Dataset linkage:**  
→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_MYCOLOGY_LD_PROOFS.md` (LD2)

---

## LD3 — Environmental Interaction and Ecological Function

**Regime:** decomposition dynamics, symbiosis (e.g., mycorrhizae), pathogenic interaction, substrate selection  
**Characteristic scales:** hours → seasons; microhabitats → ecosystems

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Decomposition rates and carbon turnover contributions
- Symbiotic colonization rates (root association metrics)
- Spore dispersal and settlement probabilities
- Environmental tolerance ranges (pH, moisture, temperature)
- Competitive interaction outcomes on shared substrates

**Dataset linkage:**  
→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_MYCOLOGY_LD_PROOFS.md` (LD3)

---

## LD4 — Reproduction, Life-Cycle Continuity, and Population Persistence

**Regime:** sporulation, mating systems, fruiting body formation, population genetics  
**Characteristic scales:** life cycles → generations

### Scientifically Supported Fungal “Metamorphics” (Lifecycle Transitions)

In mycology, “metamorphics” here refers only to **empirically documented lifecycle state transitions**, including:

- spore → germ tube → hypha → mycelium  
- mycelium → fruiting body (where applicable)  
- asexual ↔ sexual reproduction switching (species dependent)  
- **dimorphism** in some fungi (yeast-like ↔ filamentous forms) under environmental cues

These are **regulated developmental state changes**, not identity persistence and not LDF evidence.

### Empirically Measurable Parameters
- Sporulation thresholds and rates
- Fruiting initiation conditions and timing
- Mating compatibility and reproductive output
- Population genetic diversity and structure (where studied)
- Persistence of populations across seasonal and climatic variation

**Dataset linkage:**  
→ `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_MYCOLOGY_LD_PROOFS.md` (LD4)

## LD vs LDF Boundary Note (Non-Declarative)

Fungal networks can exhibit:
- complex growth patterns,
- adaptive resource allocation,
- biochemical signaling,
- distributed response to environmental conditions.

However:
- LD classification does not assert selfhood or internal identity.
- No LD→LDF transition is declared here.
- Any claim of coupling would require a separate auditable coupling file and independent proof anchors.

This file remains LD-only by design.

---

## Descriptive UCC Alignment (Non-Causal)

Used strictly as structural descriptors:

- **τ (delay):** growth timing, developmental transitions, seasonal cycles  
- **Σ (structure):** hyphal architecture, mycelial network organization, reproductive morphology  
- **μ (persistence):** lifecycle recurrence, ecological continuity, population persistence  

No symbolic, ethical, or identity meaning is implied.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ defines LD as Light Dimension
- ✔ includes only scientifically supported fungal lifecycle transitions
- ✔ preserves strict LD-only classification

This document does **not**:
- ✖ assert selfhood or consciousness
- ✖ claim LDF by default
- ✖ introduce new glyphs or metaphysics

Any contradiction by future evidence requires revision or removal.
