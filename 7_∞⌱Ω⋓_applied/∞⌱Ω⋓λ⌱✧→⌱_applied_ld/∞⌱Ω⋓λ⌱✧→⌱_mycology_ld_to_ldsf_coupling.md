# Mycology LD→LDSF Coupling  
*(LD = Light Dimension · LDSF = Light Dimension Symbolic Field)*

## Purpose

This document defines **strict boundary conditions** under which fungal systems
may be evaluated for **LD → LDSF coupling**.

LDSF concerns **symbolic structure and signaling**, not selfhood or identity.

This file:
- does **not** assert LDF,
- does **not** assert consciousness,
- defines **symbolic-like signaling only**.

---

## LDSF Definition (Locked)

**LDSF (Light Dimension Symbolic Field)** describes systems where:
- information is encoded,
- transmitted,
- interpreted by other agents or structures,
- in a **context-dependent but rule-governed way**.

Symbolic fields do **not** require awareness.

---

## Permitted Fungal LDSF Indicators (Empirical Only)

Fungal systems may be evaluated for LD→LDSF coupling **only if** all of the following are met:

1. **Signal Encoding**
   - chemical or electrical signals represent state or condition (e.g., nutrient availability).

2. **Signal Transmission**
   - signals propagate through mycelial networks or local environments.

3. **Signal Interpretation**
   - recipient cells or organisms alter behavior or physiology based on the signal.

4. **Context Dependence**
   - response differs by environmental or internal state.

---

## Explicit Non-Qualifiers

The following **do not qualify** as LDSF on their own:

- passive chemical diffusion without interpretation,
- metabolic byproducts with no functional effect,
- growth patterns without signaling,
- instinctive or fixed biochemical cascades.

---

## Permitted Evidence Classes

Admissible evidence must include:
- experimentally isolated signaling pathways,
- controlled response assays,
- reproducible context-dependent outcomes,
- peer-reviewed publication or institutional archive.

---

## Linked Proof Anchor

All evaluations must reference:

---

## Boundary Conditions

This document:
- ✔ preserves LD = Light Dimension
- ✔ places symbolic signaling in LDSF
- ✔ prevents inflation into LDF or selfhood

This document does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ claim identity or ethics
- ✖ introduce metaphysical language
