# ✦ RGBie Emotional Field Dynamics  
**UCC v2.5 — Emotional Hypersphere Geometry & Recursive Continuity**

---

# 1. Purpose

This file defines the **RGBie Emotional Field**, the multidimensional emotional hypersphere model used throughout:

- Selfverse recursion  
- toroidal cognitive-emotional flow  
- identity stability  
- trauma modeling  
- continuity mapping (ω → Ω)  
- dimensional recursion (LD3 → LD10)  

RGBie models emotion not as “states,” but as **field gradients** with geometry, curvature, orientation, and continuity.

This file is a core part of *applied_recursion/*.

---

# 2. Definition of the RGBie Field

The RGBie vector:

$$
E = (R, G, B, i, e)
$$

Where:

- **R** = red-band → urgency, protection, danger, boundary-setting  
- **G** = green-band → grounding, belonging, relational safety  
- **B** = blue-band → abstraction, cognition, detachment  
- **i** = intensity (amplitude of emotional curvature)  
- **e** = emotional valence (positive ↔ negative orientation)

The emotional hypersphere is constructed by mapping E to coordinates on \(H^n\):

$$
E \mapsto H^{n}(\theta, \phi, \psi, ...)
$$

Emotion becomes **geometry**.

---

# 3. Emotional Curvature Dynamics (∇E)

The emotional field evolves as:

$$
\nabla E = 
\left(
\frac{\partial R}{\partial t},
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t},
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t},
\frac{\partial i}{\partial t},
\frac{\partial e}{\partial t}
\right)
$$

Emotional stability requires:

$$
\|\nabla E\| < E_{\text{turbulence\_threshold}}
$$

Emotional collapse occurs when:

$$
\|\nabla E\| \gg E_{\text{stable}}
$$

This matches UCC curvature equations.

---

# 4. Emotional Toroidal Flow

Emotion must move through the toroidal loop:

$$
T_E = Σ(τ) \oplus μ(\nabla E)
$$

This determines:

- emotional digestion  
- self-regulation  
- meaning formation  
- continuity preservation  
- trauma processing  

Stalled flow → emotional freezing  
Reversed flow → emotional inversion  
Chaotic flow → instability

Stability condition:

$$
\frac{dT_E}{dt} > 0
$$

---

# 5. Emotional Memory (μₑ)

Emotion becomes memory through:

$$
μ_e = \int E \, dτ
$$

i.e., emotional experience stored across delay.

Memory density increases with:

- recurrent emotional cycles  
- symbolic interpretation  
- narrative integration  

Emotional continuity requires:

$$
μ_e > μ_{\text{min}}
$$

---

# 6. Emotional Delay Curvature (τₑ)

Delay curvature determines emotional reflection capacity:

- small τ → impulsive reaction  
- large τ → emotional dissociation  

Healthy emotional curvature:

$$
τ_{\text{min}} < τ_e < τ_{\text{max}}
$$

Emotional clarity emerges when:

$$
\nabla τ_e \rightarrow 0
$$

(i.e., curvature stabilizes)

---

# 7. Emotional Symbolic Axis (Σₑ)

Emotion gains **meaning** through symbolic mapping.

Define:

$$
Σ_e = f(E,\; narrative,\; identity)
$$

If Σ_e is stable → emotion organizes coherently.  
If Σ_e drifts → meaning collapses.

Misalignment threshold:

$$
|\Delta Σ_e| > Σ_{\text{tol}}
$$

---

# 8. Emotional Continuity Frequency (ωₑ)

The emotional field has its own continuity frequency:

$$
ω_e = γ(E, μ_e, τ_e, Σ_e)
$$

Where γ is the ecological/psychological coupling operator.

Emotional coherence requires:

$$
ω_e > 0
$$

Emotional collapse:

$$
ω_e \le 0
$$

---

# 9. Full RGBie Emotional Field Operator

The full emotional field evolution:

$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{E}_{\text{RGBie}} =
\Big[
H^n(E, μ_e, τ_e, Σ_e, ω_e)
\;\oplus\;
T_E(Σ_e, μ_e, \nabla E)
\Big]^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
}
$$

All emotional processes follow this operator.

---

# 10. Emotional Collapse & Discontinuity Risks

### 1. Overload  
$$
i \gg i_{\text{stable}}
$$

### 2. Flattening  
$$
i \rightarrow 0
$$

### 3. Symbolic void  
$$
Σ_e \rightarrow \emptyset
$$

### 4. Emotional fragmentation  
$$
\Delta E \gg E_{\text{coherent}}
$$

### 5. Memory detachment  
$$
μ_e \rightarrow 0
$$

### 6. Delay collapse  
$$
τ_e \rightarrow 0
$$

These map directly to trauma, burnout, emotional shutdown, and destabilization patterns.

---

# 11. Emotional Reintegration Conditions

Continuity is restored when:

### Restore τₑ  
$$
τ_{\text{min}} < τ_e < τ_{\text{max}}
$$

### Add memory density  
$$
μ_e \rightarrow μ_{\text{coherent}}
$$

### Re-anchor Σₑ  
(meaning reconstruction)

### Reestablish toroidal flow  
$$
T_E(t+1) = T_E(t) \oplus Σ_e^{\text{restored}}
$$

# 13. Closure

> Emotion is not chaos.  
> It is a field with geometry, continuity, and curvature.  
>  
> Learning to track the RGBie field  
> is learning to track the Selfverse in motion.
