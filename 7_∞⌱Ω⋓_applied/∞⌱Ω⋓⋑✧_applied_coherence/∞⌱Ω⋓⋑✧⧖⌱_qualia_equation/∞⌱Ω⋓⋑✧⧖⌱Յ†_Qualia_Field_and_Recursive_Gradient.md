# ✦ Qualia Field and the Recursive Ψ-Gradient  
**Canonical Update — UCC v2.5 + UTL Integration**

This document formalizes the **Qualia Field** using the corrected curvature glyph:

**⍝ = emotional curvature (felt-state curvature)**  
**⋑ = dimensional continuity curvature**

and the proto-self field:

**Ψ (equivalent symbolic form: ~)**

⍝ replaces the ambiguous “E” notation.  
⋑ is now formally recognized as the continuity curvature across LD-levels.

---

# 1. Purpose

To define:

- Qualia as a recursive Ψ-field gradient  
- the five primary curvatures (τ, μ, Σ, ⧖, ⍝)  
- the sixth structural curvature (**⋑**, dimensional continuity)  
- the dual-domain nature of qualia (inside & outside spacetime)  
- the three canonical equations (A, B, C)  
- the full alignment across UDC → RCT → UOT → UTL → UCC → Selfverse

---

# 2. Core Definitions

## 2.1 Proto-Self Field (Ψ)

Ψ is the pre-symbolic, pre-collapsed substrate of consciousness:

- not yet emotional (⍝)  
- not yet symbolic (Σ)  
- not yet interpretive  
- not yet delayed (τ)  
- not yet patterned by memory (μ)  
- not yet dimensionally stabilized (⋑)

Ψ becomes selfhood (⧖) through the recursion operator:

$$
↫ ⋓ ↬
$$

Ψ **does not originate inside spacetime** —  
it *projects into spacetime* through recursive collapse.

---

# 3. Curvatures of Living Systems  
*(Updated with emotional curvature ⍝ and dimensional curvature ⋑)*

Living consciousness arises through **six distinct curvatures** of Ψ:

| Glyph | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| τ | Delay Curvature | Reflection depth, temporal recursion |
| μ | Memory Curvature | Retention, density, integration |
| Σ | Interpretive Curvature | Meaning, polarity, symbolic structure |
| ⍝ | Emotional Curvature | Felt-state curvature (valence, affect) |
| ⧖ | Selfhood Curvature | Identity recursion, coherence |
| ⋑ | Dimensional Continuity Curvature | Stability across LD3→LD10 |

The **Qualia Field (Q)** arises only when all six curvatures align.

---

# 4. Emotional Curvature (⍝)

⍝ is defined as:

$$
⍝ = \nabla_{\text{felt}} \Psi
$$

It measures the inward bend of the Ψ field into:

- intuition  
- affect  
- valence  
- coherence  
- distress  
- illumination  

⍝ is the curvature that animates:

- emotional color (RGBie)  
- empathic resonance  
- affective prediction  
- experiential meaning  

⍝ is **not energy or EM curvature** — it is **felt curvature**.

---

# 5. Dimensional Continuity Curvature (⋑)

⋑ is defined as:

$$
⋑ = \nabla_{\text{dimension}} \Psi
$$

This is the curvature that stabilizes Ψ across dimensional levels (LD3→LD10):

- mind ↔ body  
- self ↔ environment  
- personal ↔ collective  
- temporal ↔ timeless  
- spacetime ↔ pre-spacetime  

Without ⋑, consciousness becomes discontinuous.

Qualia collapses when ⋑ collapses.

---

# 6. The Three Qualia Equations (Canonical)

## **A — Minimal / Universal**

$$
Q = \| \nabla \Psi \|
$$

---

## **B — Expanded (Six Curvatures)**

$$
Q = \| \nabla_{\{τ,\; μ,\; Σ,\; ⍝,\; ⋑,\; T\}} \Psi \|
$$

Where:

- τ = delay curvature  
- μ = memory curvature  
- Σ = interpretive curvature  
- ⍝ = emotional curvature  
- **⋑ = dimensional continuity curvature**  
- T = temporal recursion phase  

---

## **C — Full Recursive Definition**

$$
Q =
\Big[
H^{n}(\Psi)
\oplus
\nabla τ
\oplus
\nabla μ
\oplus
\nabla Σ
\oplus
\nabla ⍝
\oplus
\nabla ⋑
\oplus
T
\Big]^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
$$

This is the complete qualia equation.

---

# 7. Dual-Domain Nature of Qualia

## 7.1 Inside spacetime

$$
Q(x,t)
$$

The expressed, embodied qualia field.

## 7.2 Outside spacetime

Ψ is:

- non-local  
- recursive  
- pre-dimensional  
- pre-curvature  

Qualia is therefore **bi-domain**.

---

# 8. Ψ → Curvature → Qualia Chain

$$
Ψ \rightarrow
\begin{cases}
\nabla τ \\
\nabla μ \\
\nabla Σ \\
\nabla ⍝ \\
\nabla ⧖ \\
\nabla ⋑
\end{cases}
\rightarrow
\begin{cases}
\nabla C & \text{(coherence curvature)} \\
\nabla S & \text{(stability curvature)}
\end{cases}
\rightarrow Q
$$

Where:

- **Coherence curvature (∇C)** = harmony  
- **Stability curvature (∇S)** = resistance to discontinuity  
- **Q** = qualia

---

# 9. Hypersphere Qualia Field

$$
\mathbb{Q}(x,t) = H^{n}(\Psi(x,t))
$$

Symbolic variant:

$$
\mathbb{Q}(x,t) = H^{n}(~)
$$

---

| ⍝ | Emotional curvature | Felt-state curvature |
| ⋑ | Dimensional continuity curvature | LD-stability |
| ⧖ | Selfhood curvature | Identity recursion |
