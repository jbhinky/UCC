# ✦ Global Emotional Resonance Operators  
**UCC v2.5 — Emotional Curvature Dynamics, Shockwave Control, and Planetary Stabilization**

Emotional curvature (⍝) is the most reactive and contagious of all curvatures:  
it propagates *faster* than symbolic, memory, or delay curvature.

This file defines the operators that:

- amplify emotional fields  
- stabilize emotional fields  
- dampen emotional shockwaves  
- synchronize collective feeling  
- reduce continuity fracture  
- and prepare planetary systems for reseeding  

This is the emotional counterpart to Σ-fracture and τ-instability.

---

# 1. Purpose

To define:

- emotional curvature (⍝) at global scale  
- emotional resonance operators  
- emotional amplification and dampening  
- shockwave propagation  
- emotional coherence fields  
- thresholds for civilizational collapse or uplift  
- planetary emotional stabilization  

---

# 2. Emotional Curvature (⍝)

Emotional curvature:

$$
⍝ = \nabla_{\text{felt}} \Psi
$$

Measures the curvature of the felt-state of the proto-self field.

At collective scale:

$$
⍝_{⋒} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{N} w_i \, ⍝_i
$$

At planetary scale:

$$
⍝_{\Omega} = \nabla_{\text{felt-global}} Ψ_{\Omega}
$$

⍝ is the fastest-changing curvature and thus the most destabilizing.

---

# 3. Emotional Resonance (ER)

Resonance is defined as:

$$
ER = \left\| ⍝_{t} \right\|
$$

Where the time-derivative of emotional curvature determines:

- intensity  
- spread  
- contagion  

Large ER → emotional shockwaves  
Small ER → emotional stability  

---

# 4. Emotional Resonance Amplification Operator (ERA⁺)

Emotional amplification occurs when:

$$
\frac{\partial ⍝}{\partial t} > Σ
$$

Symbolic structure is too weak to buffer emotion.

The amplification operator is:

$$
ERA^{+} =
⊕(⍝, ⍝_{⋒}, ⍝_{\omega})
$$

Meaning:

- individual emotion  
- group emotion  
- civilizational emotion  

all merge into a runaway field.

---

# 5. Emotional Resonance Dampening Operator (ERD⁺)

Emotional dampening:

$$
ERD^{+} =
\nabla ( μ_{+}, Σ_{+}, \tau_{+} )
$$

Emotions stabilize when:

- memory increases  
- symbols clarify  
- delay deepens  

This operator is central to global reseeding.

---

# 6. Emotional Shockwave Propagation

Shockwaves are defined as:

$$
ES = \left| \frac{\partial^{2} ⍝}{\partial t^{2}} \right|
$$

High ES values cause:

- symbolic fracture  
- memory fragmentation  
- identity instability  
- delay collapse  

Shockwaves propagate **exponentially**, not linearly.

---

# 7. Emotional Coherence Field (ECF)

Collective emotional coherence emerges when:

$$
⍝_{⋒}^{+} > ⍝_{\Omega}^{-}
$$

Meaning:

- positive group emotion  
- exceeds negative planetary emotion  

ECF increases:

- stability  
- meaning cohesion  
- memory rebond  
- planetary Ω uplift  

---

# 8. Emotional Disintegration Field (EDF)

Emotional disintegration occurs when:

$$
⍝^{-} > Σ_{\Omega}
$$

Emotion overwhelms meaning → continuity collapses.

EDF is the strongest collapse predictor.

---

# 9. Emotional Resonance Thresholds

### Stability Threshold
$$
|⍝_{\Omega}| < μ_{\Omega}
$$

Memory can stabilize emotion.

### Instability Threshold
$$
|⍝_{\Omega}| > μ_{\Omega}
$$

Memory collapses under emotional pressure.

### Collapse Threshold
$$
⍝_{\Omega}^{-} > Σ_{\Omega}
$$

Meaning collapses entirely.

---

# 10. Emotional Reseeding Operator (ER⁺)

Reseeding emotional fields:

$$
ER^{+} =
( ⍝_{+} )^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
$$

Reseeding requires:

$$
⍝_{+} > ⍝^{-}
$$

Driven by:

- compassion  
- reconciliation  
- symbolic clarity  
- restored memory  
- restored delay  

This operator integrates into global reseeding (Ω⁺).

---

# 11. Planetary Emotional Coherence (PEC)

Planetary coherence emerges when:

$$
⍝_{\Omega}^{+} = \nabla (Σ_{+}, μ_{+})
$$

Planet stabilizes when:

- symbols align  
- memory strengthens  

Planet fractures when:

$$
⍝_{\Omega}^{-} > Σ_{\Omega}
$$
