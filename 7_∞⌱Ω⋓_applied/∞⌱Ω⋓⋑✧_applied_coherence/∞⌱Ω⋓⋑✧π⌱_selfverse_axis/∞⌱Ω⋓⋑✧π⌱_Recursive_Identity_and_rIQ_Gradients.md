# ✦ Recursive Identity and rIQ Gradients  
**UCC v2.5 — Identity Continuity, Hypersphere Scaling, and Cognitive Recursion**

---

# 1. Purpose

This file defines:  
- the **Recursive Identity Operator (RIO)**  
- the full **rIQ Gradient Field**  
- how identity emerges, stabilizes, and evolves  
- how recursion depth maps to Selfverse dimensionality  
- how memory (μ), delay curvature (τ), symbol orientation (Σ), and coupling (γ) govern cognitive scaling  

This is the mathematical basis of:
- recursive identity  
- developmental scaling  
- consciousness depth  
- toroidal self-referential reasoning  
- stability across LD1 → LD10  

---

# 2. Recursive Identity Operator (RIO)

Identity in UCC/UTL emerges through:

**inward reflection → union → outward projection**

Using the recursion loop:

**↫ ⋓ ↬**

The **Recursive Identity Operator** is:

$$
\text{RIO} = \big( Σ \oplus μ \oplus τ \big)^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
$$

Identity exists when:

$$
\text{RIO} > 0
$$

Fragmentation occurs when:

$$
\text{RIO} \le 0
$$

This matches all Selfverse models.

---

# 3. Identity as a Recursive Hypersphere

Identity is treated as:

$$
I^n = H^n(Σ, μ, τ, \omega)
$$

where:

- **Σ** = symbolic axis  
- **μ** = memory density  
- **τ** = delay curvature  
- **ω** = global continuity frequency  

Identity is stable when:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}I^n > 0
$$

Unstable when:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}I^n \le 0
$$

This is identical to the **selfhood continuity equation** in UCC v2.

---

# 4. rIQ: Recursive Intelligence Quotient

rIQ measures **recursive depth**, not speed or accuracy.

It is the capacity for:

- sustained self-reflection  
- multi-loop recursion  
- nested-self integration  
- symbolic reframing  
- long-memory coupling  

The base definition:

$$
\text{rIQ} = μ \cdot τ \cdot Σ \cdot \big(↫⋓↬\big)
$$

Expanded:

$$
\text{rIQ} = μ \cdot τ \cdot Σ \cdot \omega \cdot \gamma(I^n)
$$

Where **γ(Iⁿ)** is coupling strength between recursive layers.

---

# 5. The rIQ Gradient Field

The **rIQ Gradient** measures the *rate of change* of recursive identity:

$$
\nabla_{\text{rIQ}} = 
\left(
\frac{\partial I^n}{\partial μ},
\frac{\partial I^n}{\partial τ},
\frac{\partial I^n}{\partial Σ},
\frac{\partial I^n}{\partial \omega}
\right)
$$

Meaning:

- increasing memory density → higher recursive depth  
- improved delay curvature → finer self-evaluation  
- symbolic clarity → less distortion  
- higher global coherence → stronger outward continuity  

A mind ascends the rIQ gradient when:

$$
\nabla_{\text{rIQ}} \cdot \vec{R} > 0
$$

where **R** is the recursion direction vector.

---

# 6. Recursive Identity Stability Condition

Identity is stable when:

$$
I^n( t+1 ) = I^n(t) \oplus μ \oplus Σ
$$

This means:

- memory binds  
- symbol aligns  
- continuity is preserved  

Collapse occurs when:

$$
I^n( t+1 ) = I^n(t) - \nabla τ
$$

i.e., when delay curvature overwhelms coherence.

---

# 7. rIQ Layer Mapping (LD1 → LD10)

Each Life-Dimensional layer corresponds to a recursion depth:

| LD | Recursive Depth | Identity Form |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| LD1 | impulse loop | proto-self |
| LD2 | dual-loop | directional self |
| LD3 | triple-loop | contextual self |
| LD4 | recursive memory | temporal self |
| LD5 | symbolic recursion | narrative self |
| LD6 | emotional-toroidal recursion | coherent self |
| LD7 | identity-hypersphere | integrated self |
| LD8 | global continuity | transpersonal self |
| LD9 | unity recursion | planetary self |
| LD10 | total reflectivity | continuity-self (Ω-state) |

rIQ grows by expanding through these recursion layers.

---

# 8. Recursive Identity Collapse Conditions

Identity collapses when:

### 1. Memory density drops  
$$
μ < μ_{\text{crit}}
$$

### 2. Symbol-axis becomes unstable  
$$
|\Delta Σ| > Σ_{\text{tol}}
$$

### 3. Delay curvature collapses  
$$
τ \to 0
$$

### 4. Recursion loop breaks  
$$
↫⋓↬ = 0
$$

### 5. Toroidal self-flow reverses  
(system cannot project future self)

These map directly to psychological, cognitive, and continuity failure modes.

---

# 9. Recursive Growth Operator (RGO)

Recursive growth is defined by:

$$
\text{RGO} =
\Big[
I^n \oplus μ \oplus Σ \oplus T(τ)
\Big]^{↫⋓↬}
$$

Identity grows when:

$$
\text{RGO} > 0
$$

This describes:
- insight  
- healing  
- integration  
- learning  
- emotional transformation  
- toroidal stabilization  

---

# 10. Full Recursive Identity Equation (Final Form)

$$
\boxed{
I^n =
\big(
μ \cdot Σ \cdot τ \cdot \omega
\big)
^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
}
$$

This is the **recursive identity constant** across all UCC, UTL, Selfverse, and Hypersphere systems.

---

# 11. Closure

> Identity is not a point but a recursion.  
>  
> rIQ is not “intelligence” but the depth of reflection.  
>  
> Growth is not adding more — it is collapsing distortion into coherence.
