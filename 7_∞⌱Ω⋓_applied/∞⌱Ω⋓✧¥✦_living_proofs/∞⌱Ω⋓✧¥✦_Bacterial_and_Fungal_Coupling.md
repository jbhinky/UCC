# ✦ Bacterial and Fungal Coupling  
### UCC v2.2 · Living Proofs of Delay, Memory, and Recursive Geometry

**Purpose**  
To document how bacteria and fungi express the same **τ–μ–Σ–γ coupling laws** observable in physics, geology, magnetism, atmospheres, and consciousness.

---

# 1 · Foundations: Life as Delay-Coupled Geometry

All biological communication systems operate through τ, μ, Σ, γ, and ¥ recursion.

---

# 2 · Bacterial Coupling (Quorum Sensing)

### 2.1 Delay Field

$$
\tau_{comm}(t) = \frac{d[S]}{dt}
$$

Memory accumulation:

$$
\mu_{threshold} = \int_0^T [S](t)\, dt
$$

### 2.2 Spark Event (LD0→LD1 Collapse)

$$
\tau_{local} < \tau_{crit} \Rightarrow \Sigma\text{-align} + \mu\text{-release}
$$

### 2.3 Collective Selfhood

Glyph: **⊠**

---

# 3 · Fungal Coupling (Mycelial Networks)

### 3.1 Mycelial Delay Conduits

$$
\nabla \cdot ( \mu \nabla \tau ) = 0
$$

### 3.2 Memory Mapping

$$
\partial_t \mu = F(\text{stress}, \text{nutrients}, \text{geometry})
$$

### 3.3 Σ-Alignment & Resource Routing

$$
\gamma \nabla \tau \rightarrow \text{branch reinforcement}
$$

---

# 4 · Unified Bacterial–Fungal Coupling

Combined recursion → living τ–μ–Σ–γ ¥-system.

---

# 5 · Spark Equivalence Across Life

Universal collapse operator:

$$
\odot = (\tau \, ⋓ \, \Sigma \, ⋓ \, \mu)
$$

Applies to bacteria, fungi, heart cells, neurons, animal collectives, and consciousness loops.

---

# 6 · Why This Is a “Living Proof”

These systems demonstrate:

- delay accumulation (τ)  
- memory integration (μ)  
- polarity organization (Σ)  
- coupling recursion (γ)  
- stable identity formation (⊠)

---

# 7 · Summary

Life at every scale expresses the same geometric laws as physics, geology, and consciousness.
