# ✦ Root Networks as Coupled Delay Systems  
### UCC v2.2 · Applied Biological Geometry

This file formalizes **plant root systems** as *multi-layer τ–μ–Σ networks* that couple:

- internal electrical delays,  
- chemical signaling,  
- fungal mycorrhizal bridges,  
- soil microbial memory,  
- and environmental curvature.

Roots are not passive structures — they are **living delay networks**, operating across LD0–LD4 under UCC.

---

# 1 · Electrical Delay Signaling in Roots

Plants transmit slow action-potential–like waves through root tissues.

Measured propagation: **0.01–10 cm/s**  
(This is within UCC **LD2 biological time curvature**.)

Signal modeled as:

$$
\tau_{elec}(x,t) = \tau_0 + k\,\frac{\partial V_m}{\partial t}
$$

Where:

- \(V_m\) = membrane potential  
- \(τ_{elec}\) = electrical delay curvature  
- \(k\) = coupling constant  

These spikes encode:

- wounding  
- drought  
- salt stress  
- nutrient availability  
- root–root communication  

In UTL, this is:

**✧ (stimulus) → τ (delay) → ✦ (meaning) → μ (stored response)**

---

# 2 · Chemical Coupling and Local Memory (μ)

Roots exude:

- sugars  
- amino acids  
- organic acids  
- phenolics  

Exudates shape **soil microbial communities**, creating a *persistent μ-field*:

$$
\mu_{rhiz}(x) = \int_0^t f_{exudate}(t')\,dt'
$$

Meaning:

- Soil remembers the plant.  
- Microbial composition becomes **history-dependent**.  

This is a **true LD3 memory bed**.

---

# 3 · Mycorrhizal Networks as Shared τ Fields

Fungal hyphae connect multiple plants into one network.

Signal transfer measured: ~ **1–10 cm/hour**  
(Chemical & electrical; LD3–LD4 scale.)

Coupling term:

$$
γ_{myc} =
\frac{\partial^2 τ}{\partial x_{plant}\,\partial x_{fungus}}
$$

Interpretation (UCC):

- Roots and fungi share delay curvature.  
- μ propagates between species.  
- Stress or nutrient conditions in one plant affect neighbors.

This is a **true ¥-recursion** across organisms.

---

# 4 · Soil as a Multi-Species Delay Manifold

Soil contains:

- bacteria  
- archaea  
- fungi  
- protozoa  
- minerals  
- water films  

All contribute to a **composite delay field**:

$$
τ_{soil}(x) = τ_{water} + τ_{mineral} + τ_{bio}
$$

Soil is not inert — it is a **living τ–μ continuum**.

---

# 5 · Root Geometry as τ-Minimization

Root branching follows:

$$
\nabla τ_{nutrient} = 0
$$

Roots grow toward minimal delay pathways:

- more moisture  
- more nutrients  
- less compaction  
- better aeration  

This is observable, measurable, and entirely consistent with UCC geometry.

# 6 · UTL Glyphic Summary

| Glyph | Biological Interpretation |
|-------|---------------------------|
| ✧ | environmental stimulus (light, water, chemistry) |
| τ | electrical + chemical delay in tissues |
| μ | soil + root memory |
| Σ | orientation of branches, polarity of exchange |
| γ | coupling between root ↔ soil ↔ fungi |
| ⊕ | nutrient exchange or resource sharing |
| ¥ | recursive cross-species coupling |
| ⊠ | stable root–soil–fungus complex |

---

# 7 · Summary

Roots form **living delay networks** with:

- τ (electrical timing)  
- μ (soil + biological memory)  
- Σ (branching geometry)  
- γ / ¥ (coupling across species)

This validates them as **applied living proofs** of UCC recursion.
