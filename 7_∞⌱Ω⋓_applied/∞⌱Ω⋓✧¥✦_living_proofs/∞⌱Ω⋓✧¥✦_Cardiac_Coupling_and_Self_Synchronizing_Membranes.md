# ✦ Cardiac Coupling and Self-Synchronizing Membranes  
### UCC v2.2 · Biological Delay Geometry

The vertebrate heart is a **phase-locked τ-engine**, demonstrating living continuity across:

- electrical delay loops  
- membrane ion geometry  
- mechanical feedback  
- cross-cellular synchronization  

It is one of the strongest natural *living proofs* of UCC recursion.

# 1 · Pacemaker Cells as Delay Oscillators

SA-node cells possess intrinsic rhythmicity.

Their membrane potential cycles create:

$$
τ_{pacemaker}(t) = f(\partial V_m / \partial t)
$$

Coupled pacemaker cells exhibit **phase locking**:

$$
τ_i(t) \longrightarrow τ_j(t) \quad \text{as } γ_{ij} \rightarrow high  
$$

The heart synchronizes through **gap junction coupling** (γ).

# 2 · The Membrane as a Capacitive Delay Surface

Cardiac membranes act as:

- capacitors (storing charge → μ),  
- threshold gates (Σ → orientation of ion channels),  
- delay surfaces (τ-curvature of ion flow).

Capacitance relation:

$$
μ_{membrane} = C_m V_m
$$

Memory here = **stored electrochemical readiness**.

# 3 · Electrical Propagation as a τ-Wave

Propagation through myocardium:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{1}{R_m C_m}}
$$

In UCC:

- lower resistance → lower τ  
- higher capacitance → higher μ  

Propagation direction is set by Σ (fiber orientation).

---

# 4 · Mechano-Electrical Coupling

Stretching myocardium changes:

- ion channel probability,  
- membrane potential thresholds,  
- conduction speed,  
- rhythm stability.

Thus:

$$
\partial τ = f(\partial_{stretch} μ)
$$

The heart literally *feels its own geometry* and adjusts timing.

# 5 · Global Coherence of the Heart Field

The full-heart τ-loop:

1. SA node initiates  
2. Atrial tissue synchronizes  
3. AV node delays (literal temporal gate)  
4. His–Purkinje system distributes  
5. Ventricles contract in Σ-patterned geometry  

This is a **recursive closed-loop continuity engine**.

# 7 · Summary

The heart is a **biological UCC engine**, showing:

- τ (timing)  
- μ (electrical memory)  
- Σ (structural alignment)  
- γ (coupling)  
- ¥ (recursive feedback)  

It is a living proof of recursive delay geometry.
