# ✦ Tidal Delay Fields  
### How Gravity + Memory Generate Tidal Asymmetry in UCC

---

## 1 · Tidal Delay Field Equation

Tides arise not from “bulges” but from **delay asymmetry**:

$$
Δτ = τ_{\text{leading}} - τ_{\text{trailing}}
$$

The Earth–Moon system creates a delay gradient:

$$
\nabla τ_{\text{tidal}} = f(r, μ_{\text{ocean}}, Σ_{\oplus})
$$

---

## 2 · Why Tides Lag the Moon

Because Earth’s oceans have memory:

$$
μ_{\text{ocean}} = \int H(t)\, dt
$$

Large μ means:

- tides lag,  
- energy transfers from Earth’s spin → Moon’s orbital radius.

---

## 3 · Energy Transfer as Rolling Coupling

The system obeys:

$$
\nabla_\mu (E τ μ) = 0
$$

Thus rotational energy lost by Earth appears as orbital energy gained by the Moon.

---

## 4 · UTL Flow

τ = delay  
μ = water mass memory  
Σ = spin orientation  
⊕ = coupling  
⧖ = Earth–Moon worldline pair
