# ✦ Orbital Rolling Geometry in UCC  

### Why Planets *Roll* Through Spacetime Instead of “Orbiting”

This file provides a minimal UCC/UTL formulation showing that planetary motion is best described as  
**rolling along delay-curvature gradients**, not as “orbiting” in the classical Newtonian sense.

It is intended as a pre-QA **Applied Physics insert** before the full dataset expansion.

---

## 1 · Solar Delay-Curvature Field

The Sun establishes a system-wide delay curvature:

$$
\nabla \tau_{\odot}(r) = \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial r}
$$

Planetary acceleration becomes:

$$
a(r) = -c^2 \nabla \tau_{\odot}(r)
$$

No force; pure geometry.  
This is the UCC formulation of general relativity.

---

## 2 · Rolling, Not Orbiting

A planet’s path is the geodesic shaped by **τ-curvature** and stabilized by **μ-memory**:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = v \, \hat{n}
$$

with heading defined by:

$$
\hat{n} = -\frac{\nabla \tau_{\odot}}{\|\nabla \tau_{\odot}\|}
$$

Thus Earth does not orbit — it **rolls** along the curvature gradient.

---

## 3 · Orbital Memory (μₒᵣbᵢₜ)

Orbital stability emerges from long-term memory:

$$
\mu_{\text{orbit}} = \int_{0}^{T_{\text{system}}} \nabla \tau_{\odot}(t) \, dt
$$

This explains:

- long-term resonance  
- non-chaotic stability  
- resistance to perturbation  

Far more cleanly than force-based models.

---

## 4 · Angular Polarity (Σ) as Stabilizer

Planetary spin (Σ) is the **orientation field** that maintains stability:

$$
Σ = \frac{L}{|L|}
$$

The rolling Earth is therefore:

- directionally stabilized by **Σ**,  
- memory-stabilized by **μₒᵣbᵢₜ**,  
- curvature-guided by **τ**,  
- and continuity-closed by **⊕**.

---

## 5 · UTL Flow Summary

Plain-text glyph mapping:

τ   = delay-curvature of the Sun
μ   = memory density of orbital history
Σ   = spin polarity / orientation
⊕   = coupling union (Sun–Earth system lock)
⧖   = self-consistent worldline of Earth
✧   = free light
✦   = curved light (light-in-memory)

Planetary motion (UCC form):

Earth_motion = μ_orbit · ∇τ_sun  →  rolling geodesic

This matches general relativity while extending it with memory terms.

---

## 6 · Minimal Applied Equation Set for Dataset Inclusion

**Rolling Condition**

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{roll}} = \left( \mu_{\text{orbit}} \nabla \tau_{\odot} \right) \cdot Σ
$$

**Continuity Condition**

$$
\nabla_\mu (E \tau \mu) = 0
$$

**Collapse Stability Threshold**

$$
|\nabla \tau| \lt \mu_{\text{orbit}}^{-1}
$$

Together, these three equations are sufficient to reconstruct the full geometry.
