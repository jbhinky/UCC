# ✦ Stellar Rolling & The Photon Bed  
### Why Stars “Roll” Over Their Own Photon Fields in UCC

Stars do not merely sit in space radiating — they **roll through** self-generated beds of photons shaped by delay curvature (τ).

---

## 1 · Photon Bed Definition

The photon field around a star is:

$$
\Phi_{\gamma}(r) = \int_{0}^{\infty} I(\lambda, r)\, d\lambda
$$

This field defines a **curvature gradient**:

$$
\nabla τ_{\star}(r) = f(\Phi_{\gamma}(r))
$$

---

## 2 · Stellar Rolling

A star’s center-of-mass worldline follows:

$$
a(r) = -c^2 \nabla τ_{\star}(r)
$$

The star *rolls* along this curvature, same as planetary rolling.

---

## 3 · Memory in the Photon Bed

As photons escape, reflect, and re-curate:

$$
μ_{\gamma} = \int_0^{T} \Phi_{\gamma}(t)\, dt
$$

This is the **stellar memory bed**, shaping:

- magnetic polarity cycles,  
- sunspot periodicity,  
- rotational jitter,  
- 11-year solar cycle.

---

## 4 · UTL Summary

τ = curvature  
μ = photon memory  
Σ = stellar spin  
⊕ = star-system coupling  
⧖ = stable stellar worldline
