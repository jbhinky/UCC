# LDSF — Scope and Limits

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **scope, boundaries, and exclusion criteria** of the  
**Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

It exists to:
- prevent category drift,
- preserve auditability,
- ensure empirical discipline,
- and separate **shared-field science** from structural, individual, or ethical layers.

This file is **field-neutral** and **non-interpretive**.

---

## 2. What LDSF Is

Within UCC, an **LDSF** is defined as:

> A **shared, externally measurable field** arising when structural processes (LD) produce population-level, observer-independent patterns that persist across time and context.

Core properties of LDSF:

- **Externally measurable**
- **Observer-independent**
- **Population-level**
- **Temporally persistent**
- **Comparable across sites and institutions**

LDSF describes **what can be measured collectively**, not what is experienced individually.

---

## 3. What LDSF Is Not

LDSF explicitly does **not** include:

- ❌ subjective experience or selfhood (**LDF**)
- ❌ ethical, moral, or interfaith meaning (**LC**)
- ❌ metaphysical or teleological interpretation
- ❌ claims of intention, agency, or consciousness
- ❌ symbolic truth-value assertions

Any file that introduces these elements is **out of LDSF scope**.

---

## 4. LDSF Layer Range

In **UCC v2.5.1**, LDSF spans **four bounded layers**:

- **LDSF1 — Shared Environmental & Biological Fields**  
  (e.g., population ecology, climate systems, biological cycles)

- **LDSF2 — Coordinated Population Systems**  
  (e.g., species dynamics, language use, migration, disease spread)

- **LDSF3 — Large-Scale Social & Institutional Fields**  
  (e.g., governance, economic systems, education systems)

- **LDSF4 — Abstract Shared Symbolic Systems**  
  (e.g., formal languages, mathematics, logic, information systems)

No LDSF layer exists beyond **LDSF4**.

---

## 5. Relationship to LD (Structural Layers)

LDSF does not replace LD.

- **LD0–LD4** describe structural, physical, and biological processes.
- **LD5** functions as a **coupling operator**, not a content layer.
- LDSF begins **only after LD5 conditions are met**.

Without LD structure, LDSF cannot exist.

---

## 6. Relationship to LDF and LC

### LDSF vs LDF
- **LDSF** → shared, external, measurable
- **LDF** → individual, internal, experiential

No LDSF file may infer or imply LDF content.

### LDSF vs LC
- **LDSF** → descriptive
- **LC** → ethical, cultural, interfaith

No LDSF file may prescribe values or moral conclusions.

---

## 7. Inclusion Criteria (Mandatory)

For a system to qualify as LDSF, **all** of the following must be true:

1. Measurements can be performed independently by multiple observers.
2. Results are comparable across institutions or regions.
3. Patterns persist beyond individual entities.
4. Variables can be expressed quantitatively or categorically.
5. Uncertainty and falsifiability are explicitly defined.

Failure on any criterion disqualifies LDSF classification.

---

## 8. Exclusion Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

The following invalidate LDSF classification:

- reliance on introspection
- symbolic interpretation without measurement
- ethical or spiritual claims
- unfalsifiable assertions
- authority-based validation without data

---

## 9. Legacy Mapping Clarification

> **Legacy Note**  
> In earlier UCC versions, shared-field phenomena were sometimes grouped under higher LD indices.  
>  
> In **UCC v2.5.1**, all such phenomena are explicitly classified under **LDSF1–LDSF4**, with **LD5 defined solely as the coupling operator**, ensuring clarity and consistency.

---

## 10. Role Within UCC

This document serves as:
- a **scope lock** for all LDSF applied files,
- a **reference during audit and peer review**,
- and a **guardrail against drift** as the corpus expands.
