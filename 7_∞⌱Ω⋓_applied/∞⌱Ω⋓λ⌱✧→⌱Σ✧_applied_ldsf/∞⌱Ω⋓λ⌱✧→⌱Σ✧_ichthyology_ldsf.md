# Ichthyology — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document classifies **ichthyology (the study of fishes)** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, constrained to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Ichthyological systems qualify as LDSF because they exhibit:
- externally measurable population-level dynamics,
- spatial and temporal structure shared across observers,
- reproducible coupling to environmental constraints (temperature, oxygen, salinity, flow),
- and persistence across ecological and management timescales.

This file introduces **no new theory** and makes **no claims regarding consciousness, symbolism, or ethics**.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### LDSF Classification

- **LDSF1** — shared ecological field dynamics  
  (distribution, phenology, habitat coupling, trophic position)

- **LDSF2** — population and system-level coupling  
  (abundance, biomass, recruitment, mortality, migration, exploitation)

### Explicit Exclusions

- ❌ LDF (selfhood or subjective experience)
- ❌ LC (ethics, culture, interfaith)
- ❌ teleological or intentional interpretations

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> Earlier UCC drafts sometimes grouped population-scale biological dynamics under **LD6–LD8**.  
>  
> In **UCC v2.5.1**, these dynamics are formally classified as **LDSF1–LDSF2**, while **LD1–LD4 remain structural**, and **LD5 functions as the coupling operator** between structure and shared fields.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Ichthyology presupposes LD structure but is not reducible to it:

- **LD1:** atomic and molecular constraints (ionic gradients, protein binding, energetics)
- **LD2:** biochemical and physiological regulation (respiration chemistry, osmoregulation)
- **LD3:** organism-level transport and thermodynamics (metabolism, growth, energy budgets)
- **LD4:** spatial–temporal population structure (habitats, migration corridors, breeding grounds)

When these processes become **measurable and comparable across populations**, LD5 coupling activates and the system enters LDSF.

---

## 5. LDSF Definition (Ichthyology)

Within UCC:

> **Ichthyology as LDSF** is the shared-field study of fish populations as externally measurable systems governed by environmental constraints, life-history timing, spatial distribution, and population-level feedbacks.

This includes:
- seasonal spawning and recruitment timing,
- age and size structure,
- abundance and biomass trends,
- migration and habitat use,
- responses to temperature, oxygen, salinity, and flow,
- coupled human pressures (e.g., harvest) where measured.

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Fish systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- **Externally measurable**  
  (counts, biomass estimates, age structure, catch-per-unit-effort, acoustic surveys)

- **Observer-independent**  
  (data produced by independent institutions using standardized protocols)

- **Spatially structured**  
  (coastal shelves, pelagic zones, river basins, lakes)

- **Temporally coherent**  
  (seasonal cycles, interannual variability, decadal trends)

- **Predictable within bounds**  
  (responses to temperature, productivity, exploitation documented with uncertainty)

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions

This document **does**:
- classify ichthyology as a shared biological field,
- support LD → LDSF coupling,
- remain empirically grounded.

This document **does not**:
- assert cognition or selfhood in fish,
- infer ethical or moral status,
- extend beyond observational and population science.
