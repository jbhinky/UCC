# Planetary Ecosystems — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document defines **planetary ecosystems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Planetary ecosystems are treated as:
- shared physical–environmental systems
- governed by orbital, gravitational, and thermodynamic constraints
- persistent across geological timescales
- inclusive of planets, moons, rings, and debris clouds

No biological or experiential claims are introduced.

---

## Scope of Planetary Ecosystems

Planetary ecosystems include:

- terrestrial planets
- gas and ice giants
- natural satellites (moons)
- ring systems
- asteroid belts
- Kuiper Belt objects
- Oort Cloud bodies
- interplanetary dust and plasma environments

These systems form **shared environmental fields** within stellar systems.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Planetary Expression |
|-----------|---------------------|
| LDSF1 | Orbital mechanics and gravitational coupling |
| LDSF2 | Planet–moon–ring interactions |
| LDSF3 | Multi-body resonance and system-scale stability |

Planetary ecosystems do **not** exceed LDSF3.

---

## Planetary Composition Categories

| Category | Primary Constituents |
|--------|----------------------|
| Terrestrial planets | silicates, iron, nickel |
| Gas giants | hydrogen, helium |
| Ice giants | water, ammonia, methane ices |
| Plutonian bodies | mixed ice–rock composites |
| Ring systems | ice particles, dust |
| Debris clouds | silicate and carbonaceous material |

---

## Moons as Ecosystem Components

Moons contribute via:
- tidal interactions
- orbital stabilization
- thermal dissipation
- resonance locking

Examples:
- Earth–Moon tidal coupling
- Galilean moon resonance (Io–Europa–Ganymede)
- Saturnian ring–moon interactions

---

## Orbital and Rolling Dynamics

Planetary ecosystems exhibit:
- axial rotation
- orbital precession
- resonance locking
- rolling or tumbling rotation (non-principal axis)

These dynamics produce **stable, repeatable system behaviors**.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This classification:
- does not assert life
- does not imply consciousness
- does not extend into LDF or LC

Planetary ecosystems remain **shared physical fields**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In earlier UCC versions, planetary systems appeared under **LD7–LD8**.

They now map to:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**
