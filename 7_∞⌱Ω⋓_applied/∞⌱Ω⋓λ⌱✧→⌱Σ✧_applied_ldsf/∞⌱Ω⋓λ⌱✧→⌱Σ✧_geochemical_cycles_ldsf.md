# Geochemical Cycles — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **geochemical cycles** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, constrained to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Geochemical cycles describe the **shared, externally measurable circulation of chemical elements** through Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.

No symbolic, cognitive, or ethical claims are introduced.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF1** — planetary-scale material circulation
- **LDSF2** — coupled biological–geochemical feedback systems

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (selfhood, experience)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy)
- ❌ Teleology or intention

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> Earlier UCC models referenced elemental cycles across **LD6–LD8** as large-scale environmental structure.  
>  
> As of **UCC v2.5.1**, geochemical cycles are formally classified as **LDSF1–LDSF2**, reflecting their nature as **shared, planetary-scale fields**, with **LD5** acting as the union operator from physical structure into shared system behavior.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Geochemical cycles depend on:

- **LD1** — atomic and molecular properties
- **LD2** — chemical reactions and phase transitions
- **LD3** — thermodynamic and kinetic constraints
- **LD4** — planetary geometry, reservoirs, and timescales

No new physical or chemical laws are added at LDSF.

---

## 5. Definition of Geochemical Cycles as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Geochemical cycles are shared planetary fields describing the circulation, storage, and transformation of chemical elements across Earth systems, measurable independently of any organism or observer.**

Key cycles include:
- carbon
- nitrogen
- phosphorus
- sulfur
- oxygen
- water (hydrologic cycle)

---

## 6. Internal LD → LDSF Coupling (LD5)

**Coupling occurs internally** when:

1. Chemical elements circulate between multiple Earth reservoirs  
2. Fluxes persist across geological timescales  
3. Cycles are measurable at global or regional scales  
4. Feedbacks emerge between physical and biological components  

At this threshold, **LD5 activates**, and the system qualifies as **LDSF**.

No life, cognition, or awareness is required for classification.

---

## 7. Shared-Field Characteristics

Geochemical cycles qualify as LDSF because they are:

- **External:** exist independently of organisms
- **Shared:** affect all Earth systems simultaneously
- **Persistent:** operate from seasonal to geological timescales
- **Measurable:** fluxes and reservoirs quantified empirically

---

## 8. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- purpose or directionality
- consciousness of Earth systems
- ethical interpretation of cycles
