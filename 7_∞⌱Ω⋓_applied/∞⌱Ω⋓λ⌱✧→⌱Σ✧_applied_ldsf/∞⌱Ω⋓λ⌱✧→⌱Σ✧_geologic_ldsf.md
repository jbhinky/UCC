# Geologic Systems — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **geologic systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, constrained to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Geologic systems describe **shared, externally measurable processes** governing Earth’s structure, composition, and long-term evolution, independent of biological or cognitive activity.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF1** — planetary-scale structural systems
- **LDSF2** — dynamic geological processes over time

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (experience, selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics, symbolism)
- ❌ Teleological interpretations

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> Geological phenomena previously appeared under **LD6–LD8** as deep structural dynamics.  
>  
> As of **UCC v2.5.1**, geologic systems are formally classified as **LDSF1–LDSF2**, reflecting their role as **shared, planetary physical fields**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator**.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Geologic systems arise from:

- **LD1** — atomic and mineral properties
- **LD2** — chemical bonding and phase changes
- **LD3** — thermodynamic and kinetic constraints
- **LD4** — planetary geometry and gravity

No new physics is introduced at LDSF.

---

## 5. Definition of Geologic Systems as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Geologic systems are shared planetary fields describing the formation, transformation, and movement of Earth materials across spatial and temporal scales.**

These include:
- plate tectonics
- rock and mineral cycles
- crust–mantle dynamics
- seismic and volcanic processes

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Geologic systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- **External:** exist independently of organisms
- **Shared:** affect all surface and subsurface systems
- **Persistent:** operate across millions to billions of years
- **Measurable:** quantified through instruments and samples

---

## 7. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- planetary consciousness
- intent or purpose
- symbolic meaning
