# Atmospheric Systems — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **atmospheric systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

Atmospheric systems are:
- **shared**
- **external**
- **non-internalized**
- **planetary-scale coordination fields**

They provide a **common physical and temporal environment** for all surface-bound biological and social systems without requiring cognition, selfhood, or interpretation.

This file introduces **no ethics**, **no consciousness**, and **no symbolic meaning**.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Layer
- **LDSF1** (Shared environmental coordination)

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LD (pure structure only)
- ❌ LDF (internal experience or selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy, or meaning)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In legacy UCC versions (≤2.5.0), atmospheric systems were treated implicitly within **LD6 (shared physical fields)** on the shared LD map.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, shared domains are formally separated as **LDSF**, with **LD5 functioning as the union operator** between LD (structure) and LDSF (shared coordination).  
>  
> This file operates at **LDSF1**, corresponding to **legacy LD6**.

---

## 4. LD Lineage (Structural Parentage)

Atmospheric systems emerge from the following **LD foundations**:

- **LD1–LD2**: molecular kinetics and gas dynamics  
- **LD3**: thermodynamics and phase transitions  
- **LD4**: planetary gravity, rotation, solar input, and orbital stability  

Atmospheric systems **do not introduce new structure**.  
They **coordinate existing structure** into a persistent shared field.

---

## 5. Definition of Atmospheric Systems (LDSF)

Within UCC, **atmospheric systems** are defined as:

> **Planetary-scale, physically constrained gaseous envelopes whose thermodynamic, chemical, and dynamical processes create shared environmental conditions across spatial and temporal scales.**

These systems:
- distribute energy
- regulate temperature
- transport matter
- establish temporal rhythms (day/night, seasonal cycles)
- constrain habitability

All surface-bound life and human systems operate **within** this field.

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Atmospheric systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

### 6.1 External
They exist independently of organisms or observers.

### 6.2 Collective
They affect all entities within their spatial domain simultaneously.

### 6.3 Coordinative
They synchronize:
- climate zones
- weather patterns
- seasonal cycles
- migration timing
- agricultural viability

### 6.4 Non-Internalized
They do not require perception, awareness, or interpretation to function.

---

## 7. Functional Domains

Atmospheric systems coordinate multiple shared domains:

- **Energy distribution** (solar radiation, infrared re-emission)
- **Mass transport** (water vapor, aerosols, trace gases)
- **Temporal modulation** (diurnal and seasonal cycles)
- **Boundary regulation** (pressure, temperature gradients)
- **Coupling interfaces** (land–atmosphere, ocean–atmosphere)

These functions act as **preconditions** for biological, ecological, and social LDSF fields.

---

## 8. Constraints and Boundaries

Atmospheric systems are bounded by:

- planetary gravity
- solar flux
- chemical composition
- rotational dynamics
- thermodynamic laws

They do **not**:
- adapt intentionally
- encode meaning
- store memory
- exhibit self-reference

Any such properties emerge **only later** through biological or cognitive coupling.

---

## 9. Relation to Other LDSF Fields

Atmospheric systems directly support:

- `ecology_ldsf`
- `oceanic_systems_ldsf`
- `botany_ldsf`
- `biology_ldsf`
- `civilization_ldsf`

They act as a **shared baseline field** rather than a specialized domain.

---

## 10. Coupling Status

- **LD → LDSF coupling**: REQUIRED  
  (addressed in a dedicated coupling file)

- **LDSF → LDF coupling**: NOT APPLICABLE  
  Atmospheric systems do not internalize directly into selfhood.

---

## 11. Falsifiability and Revision

This file is subject to revision if:

- planetary atmospheric dynamics are shown to violate thermodynamic constraints,
- shared coordination functions are invalidated by empirical evidence,
- or planetary atmospheres are demonstrated to require internal agency.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
