# Herpetology — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **herpetology** (amphibians + reptiles) as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, constrained to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Herpetology is classified as LDSF because amphibian and reptile systems are:
- externally measurable,
- shareable across observers and institutions,
- persistent across seasons to evolutionary timescales,
- and governed by coupled environmental constraints (temperature, moisture, habitat, disease, trophic interactions).

This file introduces **no new theory** and contains **no symbolic, ethical, or consciousness claims**.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Classification
- **LDSF1** — shared ecological and environmental dynamics (habitat, climate constraints, distribution, phenology)
- **LDSF2** — coupled population/health feedback systems at regional-to-global scale (declines, recovery, disease ecology)

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (selfhood / subjective experience)
- ❌ LC (ethics / interfaith)
- ❌ teleology or “intent” in nature

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> Older UCC drafts sometimes described vertebrate field dynamics under **LD6–LD8** as “living” layers.  
>  
> In **UCC v2.5.1**, these are formally placed as **LDSF1–LDSF2** (shared-field ecology), while **LD1–LD4 remain structural**, and **LD5 remains the coupling operator** bridging structural processes into shared fields.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Herpetology depends on LD structure but is not reducible to LD-only descriptions:

- **LD1:** atomic/molecular constraints on physiology (e.g., ion channels, metabolic chemistry)
- **LD2:** tissue/biochemical interactions (enzymes, membranes, endocrine chemistry)
- **LD3:** organism-level thermodynamics and transport (heat, water balance)
- **LD4:** population- and habitat-scale constraints in space and time

---

## 5. LDSF Definition (Herpetology)

Within UCC:

> **Herpetology as LDSF** is the shared-field study of amphibian and reptile distributions, phenology, population dynamics, and health drivers as externally measurable systems coupled to environment and time.

This includes:
- seasonal timing (breeding, migration, dormancy)
- range and distribution change
- abundance and occupancy patterns
- disease dynamics (e.g., chytrid in amphibians)
- habitat fragmentation and restoration response

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Herpetology qualifies as LDSF because it is:

- **Externally measurable:** counts, occupancy, movement, disease prevalence, physiology proxies
- **Shared across observers:** standardized monitoring protocols exist
- **Cross-site comparable:** datasets compiled across regions and decades
- **Predictive under constraints:** temperature/precipitation and habitat drivers predict phenology and occupancy within bounded uncertainty

---

## 7. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This document does **not** claim:
- a consciousness threshold for animals,
- moral status inference,
- or metaphysical interpretation.

It classifies herpetology strictly as a **shared measurable field**.
