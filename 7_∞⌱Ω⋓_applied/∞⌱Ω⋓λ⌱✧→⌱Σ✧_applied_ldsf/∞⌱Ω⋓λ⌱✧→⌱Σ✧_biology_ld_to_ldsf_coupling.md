# Biology — LD → LDSF Coupling

## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the **classification coupling** by which **biological phenomena**, fully governed by **LD (Light Dimension) structural laws**, are reclassified as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

This coupling:
- introduces **no new physics**
- introduces **no internal awareness**
- performs **no interpretive action**

It strictly formalizes **when biological structure becomes shared coordination**.

---

## 2. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC versions ≤2.5.0, population-scale biological phenomena were distributed across **LD6–LD7** on the shared LD map.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, shared biological coordination is explicitly separated into **LDSF**, with **LD5 functioning as the union operator** between LD (structural constraints) and LDSF (shared coordination fields).

---

## 3. LD Foundations (Pre-Coupling)

Biological systems arise entirely within LD:

- **LD1** — molecular structure, chemical bonding  
- **LD2** — biochemical reactions and regulatory kinetics  
- **LD3** — thermodynamics of open, dissipative systems  
- **LD4** — planetary stability, cycles, and environmental constraints  

At this stage:
- life processes are **local**
- interactions are **structural**
- no shared-field designation applies

---

## 4. LD5 — Union Operator for Shared Biology

The LD → LDSF transition occurs through **LD5**, defined as:

> **The operator that binds LD4-structured biological processes into externally shared spatial–temporal coordination fields.**

LD5:
- is **not** a new dimension
- adds **no dynamics**
- establishes **shared reference frames** for biological interaction

This includes:
- overlapping habitats
- shared reproductive timing
- shared selection pressures
- population-scale interaction networks

---

## 5. Coupling Conditions

Biological processes are classified as **LDSF** when all of the following are satisfied:

1. **Multiplicity of agents**  
   More than one organism participates in the process.

2. **External coordination**  
   Interaction occurs through environment-mediated constraints rather than internal cognition.

3. **Temporal persistence**  
   Patterns persist across multiple life cycles or generations.

4. **Observability at collective scale**  
   Effects are measurable without reference to internal experience.

When these conditions are met, biological structure becomes a **shared field**.

---

## 6. Resulting Classification

After LD5 coupling:

- physical and biochemical laws remain unchanged
- biological phenomena retain LD governance
- classification shifts to **LDSF1** due to shared coordination

No agency or awareness is introduced.

---

## 7. Explicit Exclusions

This coupling does **not**:

- assert consciousness
- imply intention
- internalize experience
- define selfhood

Those transitions require **LDF coupling** and are not addressed here.

---

## 8. Relation to Downstream Couplings

This LD → LDSF coupling enables, but does not guarantee:

- `biology_ldsf_to_ldf_coupling` (only for specific lineages)
- ecological LDSF expansion
- civilization-level LDSF fields

Each downstream coupling requires its **own justification and dataset**.

---

## 9. Falsifiability and Revision

This coupling must be revised if:

- population-scale biological coordination is shown to be illusory,
- biological systems are shown to require internal awareness for coordination,
- or shared biological dynamics fail empirical validation.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
