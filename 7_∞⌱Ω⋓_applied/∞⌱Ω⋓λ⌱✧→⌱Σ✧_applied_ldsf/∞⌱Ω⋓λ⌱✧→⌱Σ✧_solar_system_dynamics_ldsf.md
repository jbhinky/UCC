# Solar System Dynamics — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **solar system dynamics** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Solar system dynamics describe **shared, externally measurable behaviors** governing:
- planetary motion
- moon–planet interactions
- resonances
- rotational and orbital stability

No biological, experiential, or symbolic claims are introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Solar system dynamics qualify as an LDSF because they are:

- shared across observers
- governed by invariant physical laws
- externally measurable and predictive
- persistent across geological timescales

They do **not** require:
- consciousness
- symbolic interpretation
- local observers

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| LDSF1 | Keplerian orbital motion |
| LDSF2 | Multi-body resonance and perturbation |

Solar system dynamics do **not exceed LDSF2**.

---

## Core Dynamical Components

### Orbital Motion
- semi-major axis
- eccentricity
- inclination
- precession

### Rotational Dynamics
- axial rotation
- obliquity
- spin–orbit coupling

### Resonance
- mean-motion resonance
- secular resonance
- tidal locking

---

## Shared System Interactions

### Planet–Moon Systems
Examples:
- Earth–Moon tidal coupling
- Jupiter–Galilean moon resonance (1:2:4)
- Saturn–ring–moon interactions

These interactions stabilize or destabilize system evolution.

---

## Rolling and Non-Principal Rotation

Observed solar system bodies exhibit:
- chaotic rotation
- tumbling
- non-principal axis spin

Documented in:
- Hyperion
- asteroids
- irregular satellites

These behaviors remain deterministic and measurable.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF:
- ✔ remains purely physical
- ✔ remains non-experiential
- ✔ remains predictive

This LDSF does **not**:
- ✖ assert life
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ enter LDF or LC domains

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In UCC versions ≤ 2.5.0, solar system dynamics appeared under **LD7**.

They now map cleanly to:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**

No reinterpretation of prior data is required.

---

## Falsifiability

This classification must be revised if:
- orbital solutions lose predictive power,
- resonances fail independent replication,
- or dynamics collapse to non-shared, observer-dependent effects.
