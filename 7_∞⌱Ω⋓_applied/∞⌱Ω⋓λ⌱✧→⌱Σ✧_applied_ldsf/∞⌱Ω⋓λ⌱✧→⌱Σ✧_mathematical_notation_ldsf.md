# Mathematical Notation — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **mathematical notation systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Mathematical notation is treated here as:
- a shared symbolic infrastructure,
- grounded in physical inscription and perception,
- enabling stable transmission of quantitative structure,
- without requiring individual subjective experience.

This file introduces no new mathematical system.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Mathematical notation qualifies as LDSF because it exhibits:

- intersubjective stability
- cross-cultural transmissibility
- independence from individual cognition
- persistence across generations
- shared interpretability under constraint

Notation systems exist **between** physical structure (LD) and experience (LDF).

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Notational Properties |
|-----------|----------------------|
| LDSF1 | Physical inscription and symbol persistence |
| LDSF2 | Shared syntactic conventions |
| LDSF3 | Abstract symbolic systems enabling reasoning |

Mathematical notation does **not** extend into LDSF4 by itself.

---

## Structural Characteristics

- symbols mapped to quantities or relations  
- syntax governed by agreed rules  
- semantics constrained by formal consistency  
- medium-independent realization (paper, stone, digital)  

All characteristics are externally observable.

---

## Relationship to UTL (Non-Exclusive)

UTL may function as a **notation bridge** within LDSF by:
- encoding mathematical relations glyphically,
- preserving structure across representational domains,
- remaining substrate-independent.

UTL does **not** replace existing mathematical notation and introduces no new axioms here.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This classification does **not** assert:
- mathematical truth as metaphysical
- consciousness in notation systems
- semantic meaning beyond formal use

Experience, interpretation, and insight belong only to **LDF**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In earlier UCC models, formal symbolic systems were sometimes referenced under **LD7–LD8**.

These now map as:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**

This document clarifies scope without rewriting prior files.
