# Migration and Rhythm — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **migration patterns and rhythmic biological cycles** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

These phenomena are treated as:
- shared, population-level temporal structures,
- constrained by physical and environmental LD parameters,
- expressed collectively across organisms and systems,
- without requiring subjective experience or selfhood.

No interpretation or theory is introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Migration and rhythm qualify as LDSF because they exhibit:

- population-synchronous timing
- environmental entrainment
- intergenerational persistence
- shared phase alignment
- external observability and measurement

They are **qualitative temporal patterns** emerging from quantitative constraints.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| LDSF1 | Periodic biological timing (daily, tidal, seasonal) |
| LDSF2 | Coordinated group migration and movement |
| LDSF3 | Large-scale rhythmic synchronization across regions |

No migration or rhythm system exceeds **LDSF3** without entering experiential domains.

---

## Structural Characteristics (Externally Measurable)

- circadian and circannual cycles  
- photoperiod sensitivity  
- geomagnetic and celestial cue use  
- temperature and resource coupling  
- phase-locked population movement  

All characteristics are quantifiable.

---

## LD Foundations

Migration and rhythm are constrained by:

- **LD1** — atomic and molecular kinetics  
- **LD2** — biochemical oscillators (e.g., gene expression cycles)  
- **LD3** — organism-level regulation  
- **LD4** — environmental and planetary cycles  

These LD regimes fully bound LDSF behavior.

---

## Shared Systems Examples (Non-Exhaustive)

- avian seasonal migration  
- mammalian herd movement  
- insect emergence cycles  
- marine spawning migrations  
- plant flowering and dormancy cycles  
- human circadian and societal rhythms  

All examples are treated structurally, not cognitively.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF classification does **not** assert:
- intention
- planning
- awareness
- consciousness

Rhythm and migration are **shared temporal fields**, not experiential states.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In earlier UCC models, rhythmic and migratory systems were often referenced under **LD7–LD8**.

These now map as:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**

This document clarifies scope without revising historical files.
