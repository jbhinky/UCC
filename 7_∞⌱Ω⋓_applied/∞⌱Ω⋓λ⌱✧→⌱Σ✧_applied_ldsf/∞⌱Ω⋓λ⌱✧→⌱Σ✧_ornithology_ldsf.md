# Ornithology — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **avian systems (ornithology)** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Bird systems are treated here as:
- shared biological and ecological systems,
- governed by physical, aerodynamic, and physiological constraints,
- exhibiting population-level coordination and persistence,
- without asserting individual subjective experience.

No theory or interpretation is introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Ornithological systems qualify as LDSF because they exhibit:

- population-synchronous migration
- collective flight coordination
- shared reproductive and nesting cycles
- intergenerational route persistence
- externally measurable behavioral regularities

These properties exist **above individual organisms** and are **replicable across populations**.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Avian Expression |
|-----------|------------------|
| LDSF1 | Physiological and developmental regularities |
| LDSF2 | Population-scale coordination and flocking |
| LDSF3 | Continental-scale migration systems |

Avian systems do **not** exceed LDSF3 without entering experiential domains.

---

## Structural Characteristics (Externally Measurable)

- wing morphology and loading
- metabolic flight cost
- migration timing and distance
- flock geometry and spacing
- nesting periodicity

All characteristics are quantitatively measurable.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF classification does **not** assert:
- self-awareness
- intentional planning
- symbolic cognition

Such properties, where applicable, are handled only in **LDF**.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In earlier UCC models, avian systems were referenced under **LD7–LD8**.

These now map to:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**
