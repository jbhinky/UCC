# Entomology — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **entomology** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, limited to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Entomology concerns **externally observable insect systems**—their life cycles, populations, interactions, and ecological roles—treated strictly as **shared biological fields**, not cognitive or symbolic systems.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF1** — insect populations as shared biological systems
- **LDSF2** — large-scale coordination and ecosystem participation

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (selfhood or awareness)
- ❌ LC (ethics, meaning, culture)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> In earlier UCC drafts, insect systems appeared under **LD6–LD8** as complex biological dynamics.  
>  
> As of **UCC v2.5.1**, insect systems are formally placed in **LDSF1–LDSF2**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator** from LD biological structure into shared living fields.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Entomological systems depend on:

- **LD1** — physical constraints (mechanics, temperature)
- **LD2** — biochemical processes (metabolism, signaling)
- **LD3** — energetic limits and thermodynamics
- **LD4** — environmental spatial–temporal stability

No new physical or biological laws are introduced.

---

## 5. Definition of Entomology as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Entomology is the shared biological field describing insect life cycles, population dynamics, and interactions with environments, measurable independently of individual organisms.**

This includes:
- development and metamorphosis
- population regulation
- pollination and trophic roles
- collective insect dynamics

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Entomology qualifies as LDSF because it is:

- **External:** populations exist beyond individuals
- **Shared:** insects co-occupy ecological fields
- **Persistent:** cycles recur across generations
- **Measurable:** abundance, biomass, timing, distribution

---

## 7. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- insect consciousness
- symbolic communication beyond signaling
- moral or cultural agency
