# Collective Behavior — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **collective behavior** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

Collective behavior refers to **externally observable coordination patterns** that emerge when multiple agents interact under shared physical, biological, or environmental constraints.

Examples include:
- flocking and schooling
- swarming and herding
- synchronized movement or signaling
- distributed decision patterns
- phase-locked or threshold-based coordination

This file makes **no claims** about:
- internal experience
- cognition
- intention
- ethics or meaning

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Layer
- **LDSF1–LDSF2**

Collective behavior spans:
- **LDSF1** — physical and biological coordination
- **LDSF2** — social and population-scale coordination

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LDF (internal selfhood or awareness)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy, interfaith)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC versions ≤2.5.0, collective behavior phenomena were distributed across **LD6–LD8** as shared dynamics.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, collective coordination is explicitly classified as **LDSF**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator** between LD structural interaction and LDSF shared fields.

---

## 4. LD Lineage (Structural Parentage)

Collective behavior arises from LD foundations including:

- **LD1** — physical interaction rules (distance, force, motion)
- **LD2** — signaling mechanisms (chemical, visual, acoustic)
- **LD3** — energetic and thermodynamic constraints
- **LD4** — environmental geometry and boundary conditions

No new laws are introduced at the LDSF layer.

---

## 5. Definition of Collective Behavior as LDSF

Within UCC, collective behavior qualifies as **LDSF** when defined as:

> **Externally observable coordination fields produced by multiple agents interacting through shared rules and environments, resulting in coherent group-level patterns independent of individual internal states.**

This includes:
- alignment
- cohesion
- separation
- threshold-based transitions
- distributed response to perturbation

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Collective behavior meets LDSF criteria because it is:

### 6.1 External  
Patterns exist independently of any single agent.

### 6.2 Simultaneous  
Multiple agents experience and contribute to the same coordination field.

### 6.3 Scalable  
Patterns persist across:
- group size
- time
- environmental variation

### 6.4 Measurable  
Observed through:
- spatial statistics
- velocity correlation
- phase coherence
- order parameters

---

## 7. LD → LDSF Coupling (Inline)

**Coupling Operator:** LD5

Collective behavior enters LDSF when:

1. Interactions extend beyond pairwise dynamics  
2. Group-level patterns persist over time  
3. Coordination is mediated by shared constraints  
4. Effects are externally measurable at the population level  

No cognition or internal experience is required for this transition.

---

## 8. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- consciousness
- symbolic reasoning
- moral agency
- centralized control

Collective behavior is treated strictly as **emergent coordination**, not intention.

---

## 9. Relation to Other LDSF Fields

Collective behavior interfaces with:
- `biology_ldsf`
- `ecology_ldsf`
- `cephalopod_ldsf`
- `ornithology_ldsf`
- `civilization_ldsf`

It functions as a **cross-cutting shared coordination field**.

---

## 10. Falsifiability and Revision

This file must be revised if:
- group-level coordination cannot be empirically demonstrated,
- patterns fail replication,
- or coordination requires internal awareness.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
