# Mycology — LD → LDSF Coupling

## Purpose

This document describes how **fungal systems couple from LD-governed structure into LDSF shared biological fields**.

No experiential or symbolic claims are made.

---

## LD Inputs

Fungal systems are constrained by:

- **LD1** — atomic and molecular structure  
- **LD2** — chemical bonding and enzymatic reactions  
- **LD3** — cellular and tissue-like organization (hyphae)  
- **LD4** — organism-scale growth and regulation  

No LD beyond LD4 is required.

---

## Coupling Mechanism

LD → LDSF coupling occurs when:

- hyphal growth links into persistent networks
- metabolic exchange spans spatial regions
- populations coordinate via shared substrates
- decomposition and symbiosis alter ecosystems

These processes produce **shared fields** rather than isolated organisms.

---

## Resulting LDSF Properties

- mycelial transport networks  
- coordinated nutrient cycling  
- plant–fungal symbioses  
- ecosystem-level decomposition dynamics  

These are externally observable.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

This coupling:
- does not generate LDF
- does not imply cognition
- does not imply experience

---

**Status:** Publish-ready  
**Role:** Structural coupling reference (LD → LDSF) for fungal systems
