# Botany — LD → LDSF Coupling

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **classification coupling** by which **plant-based phenomena**, governed entirely by **LD (Light Dimension) structural laws**, are reclassified as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

This coupling:
- introduces **no new physics**
- introduces **no agency or awareness**
- performs **no interpretation**

It strictly identifies **when plant structure becomes shared environmental coordination**.

---

## 2. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC versions ≤2.5.0, plant-mediated environmental coordination was embedded across **LD6–LD7** on the shared LD map.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, shared plant coordination is explicitly classified as **LDSF**, with **LD5 functioning as the union operator** between LD (structure) and LDSF (shared coordination fields).

---

## 3. LD Foundations (Pre-Coupling)

Plant systems arise entirely within LD:

- **LD1** — molecular structure (carbon, water, minerals)  
- **LD2** — biochemical pathways (photosynthesis, respiration)  
- **LD3** — thermodynamics of open systems (energy capture, dissipation)  
- **LD4** — planetary cycles (solar forcing, seasons, hydrology)

At this stage:
- plant processes are **local**
- interactions are **structural**
- no shared-field designation applies

---

## 4. LD5 — Union Operator for Shared Botany

The LD → LDSF transition occurs via **LD5**, defined as:

> **The operator that binds LD4-structured plant processes into externally shared spatial–temporal coordination fields.**

LD5:
- is **not** a new dimension
- introduces **no dynamics**
- establishes **shared reference frames** for plant-mediated effects

This includes:
- shared growing seasons
- synchronized phenology
- landscape-scale vegetation patterns
- plant-mediated climate coupling

---

## 5. Coupling Conditions

Plant phenomena are classified as **LDSF** when all of the following are met:

1. **Population-level presence**  
   Multiple plants contribute to the effect.

2. **Environmental mediation**  
   Coordination occurs via soil, atmosphere, water, and light.

3. **Temporal persistence**  
   Patterns persist across seasonal or multi-year cycles.

4. **External observability**  
   Effects are measurable without reference to internal processes.

When these conditions are satisfied, LD plant structure becomes a **shared field**.

---

## 6. Resulting Classification

After LD5 coupling:

- biochemical and physical laws remain unchanged
- plant systems retain LD governance
- classification shifts to **LDSF1** due to shared environmental coordination

No internal experience or awareness is introduced.

---

## 7. Explicit Exclusions

This coupling does **not**:

- assert consciousness
- imply intentionality
- introduce symbolic meaning
- generate selfhood

Such properties require **LDF coupling** and are not addressed here.

---

## 8. Relation to Other LDSF Couplings

This coupling enables downstream coordination with:

- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_atmospheric_systems_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_biology_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_ecology_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_soil_systems_ldsf` (if defined)

Each additional coupling must be independently justified.

---

## 9. Falsifiability and Revision

This coupling must be revised if:

- plant-mediated environmental coordination is invalidated,
- phenological synchronization is disproven,
- or plant systems are shown not to influence shared environments.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
