# Ecology — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **ecology** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

Ecology concerns **externally observable interactions** between organisms and their physical environments, forming **shared, measurable systems** that persist independently of any single organism.

This file introduces:
- no ethics
- no cognition
- no symbolic meaning

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF1–LDSF2**

Ecological systems operate as:
- **LDSF1** — shared physical–biological environments
- **LDSF2** — population-level interaction networks

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LD (purely structural physics)
- ❌ LDF (internal selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics or worldview)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> In earlier UCC versions, ecological systems appeared under **LD6–LD8** as environmental coordination layers.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, ecology is formally placed in **LDSF**, with **LD5 serving as the union operator** from physical structure into shared living fields.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Ecology depends on lower LD layers:

- **LD1** — physical laws (energy, matter)
- **LD2** — chemical cycling
- **LD3** — thermodynamics
- **LD4** — planetary and environmental geometry

No new physical principles are added at the LDSF layer.

---

## 5. Definition of Ecology as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Ecology is the shared field formed by interactions among organisms and environments, governed by physical constraints and resulting in stable, measurable system-level dynamics.**

This includes:
- nutrient cycles
- trophic networks
- population regulation
- habitat structure
- disturbance–recovery dynamics

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Ecology qualifies as LDSF because it is:

### 6.1 External  
Ecosystems exist independently of individual organisms.

### 6.2 Collective  
Multiple species and abiotic components co-occupy the same field.

### 6.3 Persistent  
Systems endure across time scales longer than individual lifespans.

### 6.4 Measurable  
Observed via:
- biomass
- energy flux
- species abundance
- nutrient concentration

---

## 7. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** claim:
- awareness
- intention
- morality
- symbolic interpretation

Ecology is treated strictly as a **shared interaction field**.

---

## 8. Relation to Other LDSF Files

Ecology interfaces with:
- `biology_ldsf`
- `botany_ldsf`
- `microbiology_ldsf`
- `climate_systems_ldsf`
- `oceanic_systems_ldsf`

It acts as a **field integrator**, not a hierarchy.

---

## 9. Falsifiability and Revision

This classification must be revised if:
- ecosystems cannot be empirically measured,
- shared dynamics fail replication,
- or ecological interactions reduce to isolated LD-only processes.
