# Cosmology — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **cosmology** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, restricted to **LDSF2–LDSF3**.

Cosmology here refers to **externally observable, large-scale physical structures and dynamics of the universe**, including galaxies, clusters, mergers, and expansion—without reference to consciousness, meaning, or purpose.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF2** — shared spacetime structure and large-scale organization
- **LDSF3** — dynamical evolution of cosmic structures

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (selfhood or awareness)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy, interfaith)
- ❌ Teleology or metaphysical claims

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> In earlier UCC drafts, cosmological phenomena were sometimes referenced as **LD7–LD8**.  
>  
> As of **UCC v2.5.1**, these phenomena are formally reclassified as **LDSF2–LDSF3**, reflecting their nature as **shared, external, empirically measurable fields**.  
> **LDSF does not extend beyond level 4.**

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Cosmology depends on LD layers without extending them:

- **LD1** — fundamental physical constants and interactions
- **LD2** — matter–energy transformations
- **LD3** — thermodynamic and relativistic constraints
- **LD4** — spacetime geometry at planetary to cosmic scales

No new physical principles are introduced at LDSF.

---

## 5. Definition of Cosmology as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Cosmology is the shared field describing the structure, distribution, and dynamical evolution of matter and spacetime at the largest observable scales.**

This includes:
- galaxy formation and clustering
- galactic mergers and interactions
- large-scale filaments and voids
- cosmic expansion as measured

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Cosmology qualifies as LDSF because it is:

- **External:** independent of observers
- **Shared:** same structures observable by all observers
- **Persistent:** evolves over cosmological timescales
- **Measurable:** via redshift, lensing, and radiation fields

---

## 7. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- consciousness of the universe
- purpose or directionality beyond physical models
- symbolic or ethical meaning
