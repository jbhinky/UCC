# Education Systems — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **education systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**, limited to **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

Education systems are **externally organized, shared structures** that coordinate learning across populations through curricula, instruction, assessment, and institutional timing—independent of any single learner’s internal state.

This file introduces **no cognitive claims** and **no ethics layer**.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Classification
- **LDSF1** — shared instructional structures and environments
- **LDSF2** — population-scale learning coordination and outcomes

### Explicit Exclusions
- ❌ LDF (individual selfhood or qualia)
- ❌ LC (normative ethics, ideology)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Clarification**  
> Educational phenomena previously appeared across **LD6–LD8** as social learning layers.  
>  
> As of **UCC v2.5.1**, education is formally placed in **LDSF1–LDSF2**, with **LD5** acting as the union operator between LD physical constraints and shared instructional fields.

---

## 4. LD Structural Foundations

Education systems depend on LD layers without extending them:

- **LD1** — physical environments and materials
- **LD2** — informational encoding (text, symbols, media)
- **LD3** — temporal pacing, workload, energy constraints
- **LD4** — institutional space–time organization

No new physical principles are added at LDSF.

---

## 5. Definition of Education Systems as LDSF

Within UCC:

> **Education systems are shared fields that structure learning through delayed exposure, symbolic representation, and cumulative memory across populations.**

They include:
- curricula and standards
- instructional sequencing
- assessment cycles
- institutional calendars

---

## 6. Delay as a Structural Property (Internal Coupling)

**Delay (τ)** is intrinsic to education systems and operates as a **structural constraint**, not a defect.

### Demonstrated delay mechanisms:
- spaced instruction
- retrieval practice
- interleaved curricula
- staged assessment

**Internal Coupling (LD → LDSF via LD5):**
Education enters LDSF when learning:
1. is sequenced over time (τ),
2. uses shared symbols (Σ),
3. accumulates institutional memory (μ),
4. produces population-level outcomes.

No individual cognition is required for field classification.

---

## 7. Shared-Field Characteristics

Education systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- **External:** exist beyond any learner
- **Shared:** coordinate many learners simultaneously
- **Persistent:** extend across generations
- **Measurable:** outcomes tracked longitudinally

---

## 8. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** assert:
- consciousness formation
- moral correctness of curricula
- intrinsic meaning of knowledge

Education is treated strictly as a **shared coordination field**.
