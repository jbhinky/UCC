# Cephalopods — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **cephalopods** (octopus, squid, cuttlefish, nautilus) as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

This file addresses **shared, externally observable coordination phenomena** in cephalopod populations, including:

- collective signaling
- population-level camouflage synchronization
- shared environmental interaction
- reproductive timing
- predator–prey coordination

No internal experience, cognition, or selfhood is asserted here.

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Layer
- **LDSF1**

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LDF (internal selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics, meaning, symbolism)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC ≤2.5.0, cephalopod phenomena were grouped under **LD6–LD7 (shared biological domains)**.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, shared biological coordination is formally classified as **LDSF**, with **LD5 acting as the union operator** between LD structure and LDSF shared fields.  
>  
> This file operates at **LDSF1**, corresponding to legacy **LD6**.

---

## 4. LD Lineage (Structural Parentage)

Cephalopod systems arise from:

- **LD1** — molecular structure
- **LD2** — biochemical signaling
- **LD3** — metabolic thermodynamics
- **LD4** — marine planetary stability

These provide **structure only**, not shared coordination.

---

## 5. Definition of Cephalopods as LDSF

Within UCC, cephalopods qualify as LDSF when treated as:

> **Externally coordinated biological systems whose population-level behaviors create shared environmental interaction fields independent of individual awareness.**

Examples:
- synchronized chromatophore signaling
- collective hunting strategies
- mating season alignment
- population-scale habitat use

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

### Externality  
Behavioral patterns persist regardless of individual perception.

### Coordination  
Signaling and response propagate across multiple individuals.

### Temporal Persistence  
Patterns recur across seasons and generations.

### Observability  
All phenomena are measurable via marine observation and instrumentation.

---

## 7. Boundaries

This file does **not** claim:
- consciousness
- symbolic language
- subjective experience

Those require **LDF coupling**, handled separately.

---

## 8. Coupling Status

- **LD → LDSF coupling:** REQUIRED (see next file)
- **LDSF → LDF coupling:** CONDITIONAL (handled elsewhere)
