# Oceanic Systems — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **oceanic systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Oceanic systems are treated here as:
- large-scale shared physical–biological environments,
- governed by measurable physical and chemical constraints,
- exhibiting persistent, population-scale regularities,
- without invoking experience, intention, or cognition.

No interpretation or new theory is introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Oceanic systems qualify as LDSF because they exhibit:

- globally shared circulation patterns
- persistent thermohaline structure
- basin-scale biological coupling
- long-duration temporal stability
- cross-species ecological integration

These are **shared environmental fields**, not individual organism states.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Oceanic Expression |
|-----------|--------------------|
| LDSF1 | Physical and chemical ocean structure |
| LDSF2 | Basin-scale circulation and mixing |
| LDSF3 | Marine ecosystem integration |

Oceanic systems do **not** exceed LDSF3.

---

## Structural Characteristics (Externally Measurable)

- temperature and salinity gradients  
- density stratification  
- current velocity fields  
- nutrient and oxygen distributions  
- plankton and biomass distributions  

All characteristics are quantitatively measurable.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF classification does **not** assert:
- consciousness
- intentional coordination
- symbolic behavior

Experiential claims belong only to LDF.

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In earlier UCC models, oceanic systems were referenced under **LD7–LD8**.

These now map as:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**
