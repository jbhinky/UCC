# Herpetology — LD → LDSF Coupling (LD5)

## Purpose

This file specifies the coupling boundary where **LD1–LD4 structural biology** becomes a **shared-field system (LDSF)** for amphibians and reptiles.

---

## LD Preconditions (Structural)

Herpetological systems presuppose:

- **LD1:** atomic constraints (ions, molecular binding, energetic limits)
- **LD2:** biochemical and physiological regulation (endocrine, neural, immune chemistry)
- **LD3:** organismal transport/thermodynamics (heat, hydration, energy budgets)
- **LD4:** population and habitat geometry (space, season, landscape connectivity)

---

## Coupling Condition (LD5)

LD → LDSF coupling occurs when **structural processes become shared, externally measurable field dynamics**, specifically when:

1. **Distribution and timing** become measurable across sites (range, phenology)
2. **Population metrics** are comparable across observers (abundance/occupancy)
3. **Environmental coupling** is demonstrable (temperature, precipitation, habitat)
4. **Feedback loops** emerge at population scale (disease, fragmentation, recovery)

At this threshold, **LD5 activates**, and the phenomenon is classified as **LDSF1–LDSF2**.

---

## LDSF Outputs (What becomes measurable)

- occupancy / detection probability (standardized surveys)
- breeding phenology (timing vs climate)
- movement / dispersal proxies (mark-recapture, telemetry)
- disease prevalence (qPCR-based surveillance in amphibians)
- population trend metrics (multi-year monitoring)

---

## Boundary Notes

- LDSF classification does **not** imply cognition or selfhood.
- LDSF classification requires **shareable measurement**, not narrative interpretation.
