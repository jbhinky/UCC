# Civilization — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **civilization** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

Here, civilization refers strictly to **externally shared coordination systems created and maintained by human populations**, including:

- infrastructure
- institutions
- economic systems
- governance structures
- settlement patterns
- technological coordination
- shared symbolic standards (without interpretation)

This file does **not** address:
- individual belief
- ethics
- meaning
- identity
- internal experience

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Layer
- **LDSF2–LDSF4**, depending on domain scope

Civilization spans multiple LDSF levels because it includes:
- **LDSF1** — shared environmental and biological constraints
- **LDSF2** — shared social coordination
- **LDSF3** — shared symbolic systems (external, not internalized)
- **LDSF4** — shared civilizational continuity across generations

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LDF (individual selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy, interfaith)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC versions ≤2.5.0, civilization-level phenomena were distributed across **LD7–LD9** on the shared LD map.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, civilization is explicitly classified under **LDSF**, with **LD5 functioning as the union operator** between LD (structure) and LDSF (shared coordination fields).  
>  
> This file consolidates those legacy mappings into **LDSF2–LDSF4**, depending on scale and persistence.

---

## 4. LD Lineage (Structural Parentage)

Civilization arises from LD foundations including:

- **LD1–LD2** — material resources, energy, tools
- **LD3** — thermodynamics of production and transport
- **LD4** — planetary stability, geography, climate

Civilization does **not** introduce new physical law.  
It reorganizes physical and biological constraints into **persistent shared systems**.

---

## 5. Definition of Civilization as LDSF

Within UCC, civilization qualifies as **LDSF** when defined as:

> **Externally observable, shared coordination fields produced by human populations that structure activity, resource flow, communication, and continuity across space and time.**

This includes:
- cities and settlements
- transportation networks
- trade systems
- legal and administrative institutions
- standardized technologies
- shared measurement and record systems

All are **external**, **collective**, and **measurable**.

---

## 6. LDSF Characteristics of Civilization

### 6.1 Externality  
Civilizational systems exist independently of any single individual.

### 6.2 Collective Coordination  
They synchronize:
- labor
- movement
- production
- communication
- governance

### 6.3 Temporal Persistence  
Civilization persists across:
- generations
- regime changes
- demographic turnover

### 6.4 Observability  
Civilizational structures are observable through:
- archaeology
- historical records
- economic data
- infrastructure mapping
- institutional documentation

---

## 7. LD → LDSF Coupling (Inline)

**Coupling Operator:** LD5

Civilization enters LDSF when:

1. **Physical and biological constraints (LD1–LD4)** are organized into shared systems  
2. **Coordination exceeds individual scope**  
3. **Structures persist beyond individual lifespans**  
4. **External records and infrastructures stabilize continuity**

No internal cognition is required for this coupling.

---

## 8. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** claim that civilization:
- implies morality
- produces ethics
- guarantees progress
- requires consciousness at the system level

Those domains belong to **LC**, not LDSF.

---

## 9. Relation to Other LDSF Fields

Civilization interfaces with:

- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_calendar_and_timekeeping_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_biology_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_ecology_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_education_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_language_ldsf`
- `∞⌱Ω⋓λ⌱✧→⌱Σ✧_economics_ldsf` 

Civilization acts as a **macro-coordination field** linking multiple LDSF domains.

---

## 10. Falsifiability and Revision

This file must be revised if:

- civilization-level coordination cannot be externally measured,
- infrastructure and institutions fail persistence criteria,
- or collective coordination is shown to require internal experience.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
