# Cosmology — LD → LDSF Coupling

## Purpose

This document defines the **structural transition** by which **LD-level physical systems** form **cosmological shared fields (LDSF)**.

---

## LD Preconditions

- **LD1:** invariant physical laws
- **LD2:** matter–energy processes
- **LD3:** thermodynamic and relativistic evolution
- **LD4:** stable spacetime geometry at large scales

---

## Coupling Condition (LD5)

LD → LDSF coupling occurs when:

1. Matter distributions exceed local planetary systems  
2. Interactions occur across interstellar or intergalactic distances  
3. Dynamics persist over cosmological timescales  
4. Structures are observable through shared reference frames  

At this point, **LD5 activates**, and the system is classified as **LDSF2–LDSF3**.

---

## Resulting LDSF Properties

- large-scale structure formation
- merger-driven evolution
- expansion metrics
- gravitational lensing fields

No awareness or intent is implied.
