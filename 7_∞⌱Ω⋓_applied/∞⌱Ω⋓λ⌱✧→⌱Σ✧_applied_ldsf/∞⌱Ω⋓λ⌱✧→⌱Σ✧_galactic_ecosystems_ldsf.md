# Galactic Ecosystems — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **galactic ecosystems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Galactic ecosystems consist of **shared, externally measurable structures** formed by:
- stars
- interstellar gas and dust
- dark matter halos (inferred)
- dynamic merger and accretion processes

No biological, experiential, symbolic, or cosmological speculation is introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Galactic ecosystems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- shared across observers
- governed by invariant physical laws
- predictive at statistical and dynamical scales
- persistent over billions of years

They exceed stellar systems in scale but remain below universal or cosmological totality.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Galactic Expression |
|-----------|--------------------|
| LDSF2 | Isolated spiral and elliptical galaxies |
| LDSF3 | Interacting galaxies and merger systems |

Galactic ecosystems do **not exceed LDSF3**.

---

## Structural Components of Galactic Ecosystems

### Stellar Populations
- Population I, II, and III remnants
- age and metallicity gradients

### Interstellar Medium
- molecular clouds
- ionized plasma
- dust grains

### Galactic Halos
- baryonic halo components
- gravitationally inferred dark matter distributions

---

## Galactic Mergers and Delay-Field Coupling

### Merger Dynamics

When galaxies merge:
- gravitational potential wells overlap
- star formation rates increase
- gas compression and shock fronts form

These processes introduce **coupled delay fields**:
- one associated with gravitational interaction timescales
- one associated with nuclear and chemical processing timescales

This **dual delay structure** is measurable via:
- starburst duration
- metallicity enrichment lag

---

## Heavy-Element (Metal) Formation

### Astrophysical Production Sites
- stellar nucleosynthesis
- supernova explosions
- neutron star mergers

Heavy elements (Z > 26) form primarily through:
- r-process nucleosynthesis
- s-process nucleosynthesis

These processes are **laboratory-verified** through nuclear physics experiments and isotopic analysis.

---

## Shared Galactic Metallicity Fields

Galactic ecosystems exhibit:
- radial metallicity gradients
- merger-induced metal mixing
- delayed chemical enrichment

These patterns represent **shared chemical delay fields** across galactic volumes.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF:
- ✔ remains physical and shared
- ✔ remains non-experiential
- ✔ remains predictive and testable

This LDSF does **not**:
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ assert symbolic meaning
- ✖ extend into LC or LDF

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In UCC versions ≤ 2.5.0, galactic-scale systems appeared under **LD8–LD9**.

They now map cleanly to:
- **LD8 → LDSF3**
- **LD9 (shared chemical fields only) → LDSF3**

No reinterpretation of empirical data is required.

---

## Falsifiability

This classification must be revised if:
- galactic merger dynamics lose predictive validity,
- heavy-element formation pathways are disproven,
- or chemical enrichment ceases to correlate with merger history.
