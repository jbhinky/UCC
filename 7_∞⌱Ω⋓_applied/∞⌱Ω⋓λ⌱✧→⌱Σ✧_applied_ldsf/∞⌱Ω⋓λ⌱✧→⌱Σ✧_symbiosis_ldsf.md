# Symbiosis — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **symbiosis** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Symbiosis describes **shared, externally measurable interaction systems** in which distinct organisms maintain persistent biological coupling that alters survival, reproduction, or resource access.

No symbolic meaning, subjective experience, or ethical interpretation is introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Symbiotic systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- shared across organisms
- externally observable and measurable
- stable across generations
- governed by biochemical and ecological constraints

They do not require cognition, intention, or communication to function.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| LDSF1 | Direct metabolic coupling |
| LDSF2 | Long-term host–symbiont integration |
| LDSF3 | Ecosystem-scale symbiotic networks |

Symbiosis does **not exceed LDSF3**.

---

## Core Symbiotic Modes

### Mutualism
- both organisms benefit
- e.g., mycorrhizal fungi and plants

### Commensalism
- one benefits, other unaffected
- e.g., epiphytic organisms

### Parasitism (structural only)
- one benefits at cost to host
- measurable without ethical framing

---

## Shared System Characteristics

Symbiotic systems exhibit:
- nutrient exchange
- biochemical signaling
- structural integration
- co-regulation of growth and reproduction

All characteristics are **externally measurable**.

---

## Cross-Domain Occurrence

Observed in:
- microbial consortia
- plant–fungal systems
- animal microbiomes
- coral reef ecosystems
- lichen systems

The **interaction structure** persists across substrates.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF:
- ✔ remains biological and shared
- ✔ remains non-experiential
- ✔ remains falsifiable

This LDSF does **not**:
- ✖ imply consciousness
- ✖ imply intention
- ✖ enter LDF or LC

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In UCC versions ≤ 2.5.0, symbiotic systems appeared under **LD7–LD8**.

They now map cleanly to:
- **LD7 → LDSF2**
- **LD8 → LDSF3**

---

## Falsifiability

This classification must be revised if:
- symbiotic interactions lose measurable persistence,
- metabolic exchange ceases replication,
- or systems reduce to isolated LD-only processes.
