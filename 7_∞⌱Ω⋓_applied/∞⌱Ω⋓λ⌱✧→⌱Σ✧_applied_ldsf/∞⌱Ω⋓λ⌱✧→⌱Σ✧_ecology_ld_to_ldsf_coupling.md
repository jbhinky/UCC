# Ecology — LD → LDSF Coupling

## Purpose

This document defines the **structural coupling** by which **LD-level physical systems** transition into **ecological shared fields (LDSF)**.

No new dynamics are introduced.

---

## LD Preconditions

Ecological coupling requires:

- LD1 — conserved physical interactions
- LD2 — chemical transformation cycles
- LD3 — energy transfer and dissipation
- LD4 — spatial and temporal environmental stability

---

## Coupling Condition (LD5)

**LD → LDSF coupling occurs when:**

1. Multiple biological agents occupy the same LD-defined environment  
2. Resource exchange becomes cyclic rather than linear  
3. System behavior persists beyond individual lifetimes  
4. Interactions become population-level measurable  

At this point, **LD5 activates**, and the system qualifies as **LDSF**.

---

## Resulting LDSF Properties

- shared nutrient pools
- feedback regulation
- resilience thresholds
- non-linear recovery dynamics

No internal states are required.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This coupling:
- ✔ does not imply awareness
- ✔ does not imply coordination intent
- ✔ does not imply selfhood
