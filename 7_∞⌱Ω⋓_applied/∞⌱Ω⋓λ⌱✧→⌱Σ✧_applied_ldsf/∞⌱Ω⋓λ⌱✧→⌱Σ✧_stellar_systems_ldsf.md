# Stellar Systems — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **stellar systems** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within UCC.

Stellar systems consist of **shared, externally measurable gravitational and radiative structures** formed by stars interacting over astrophysical timescales.

No biological, experiential, symbolic, or cosmological assumptions are introduced.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Stellar systems qualify as LDSF because they are:

- observable from multiple reference frames
- governed by invariant physical laws
- predictive over long durations
- independent of local observers

They exceed single-body dynamics but remain below galactic-scale collectives.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Stellar Expression |
|-----------|-------------------|
| LDSF2 | Binary and multiple star systems |
| LDSF3 | Open clusters and globular clusters |

Stellar systems do **not exceed LDSF3**.

---

## Core Stellar System Types

### Binary and Multiple Stars
- gravitationally bound pairs or groups
- orbital periods from hours to millennia
- mass transfer and tidal interactions

### Star Clusters
- **Open clusters** (10²–10³ stars)
- **Globular clusters** (10⁴–10⁶ stars)
- long-term dynamical evolution

---

## Shared Dynamical Properties

Stellar systems exhibit:
- orbital resonance
- mass segregation
- tidal stripping
- angular momentum redistribution

All properties are **externally measurable**.

---

## Radiative and Mass Parameters

Key shared parameters include:
- stellar mass distributions
- luminosity functions
- spectral classifications
- metallicity gradients

These parameters define system-level behavior rather than individual stars.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF:
- ✔ remains physical and shared
- ✔ remains non-experiential
- ✔ remains predictive and testable

This LDSF does **not**:
- ✖ imply life or consciousness
- ✖ assert symbolic meaning
- ✖ extend into LC or LDF

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In UCC versions ≤ 2.5.0, stellar systems appeared under **LD8**.

They now map cleanly to:
- **LD8 → LDSF3**

No reinterpretation of historical data is required.

---

## Falsifiability

This classification must be revised if:
- stellar system dynamics lose predictive validity,
- cluster evolution fails observational agreement,
- or systems collapse to observer-dependent descriptions.
