# Symbolic Coordination — Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)

## Purpose

This document classifies **symbolic coordination** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** under UCC.

Symbolic coordination refers to **shared, externally observable alignment of behavior through symbols**, signals, or notational systems that function independently of subjective meaning or internal experience.

Symbols are treated here as **coordination primitives**, not semantic or conscious constructs.

---

## LDSF Classification Rationale

Symbolic coordination qualifies as LDSF because it is:

- shared across agents
- externally observable
- reproducible across cultures and species
- structurally measurable through timing, frequency, and alignment

Symbol use here is **functional**, not interpretive.

---

## LDSF Subrange Mapping

| LDSF Level | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| LDSF2 | Discrete symbolic signals enabling coordination |
| LDSF3 | Structured symbolic systems enabling large-scale alignment |

Symbolic coordination does **not exceed LDSF3**.

---

## Core Coordination Mechanisms

### Discrete Symbols
- marks
- gestures
- sounds
- signals

### Structured Symbol Systems
- notation
- signaling protocols
- repeatable symbolic sequences

These systems reduce coordination ambiguity and latency.

---

## Cross-Domain Occurrence

Symbolic coordination is observed in:
- animal signaling systems (calls, displays)
- insect pheromone trails (structural)
- human traffic symbols and signage
- mathematical notation
- musical timing marks
- calendrical markers

The **symbol substrate varies**, but coordination structure persists.

---

## Relation to UTL (Structural Only)

UTL is referenced here **only as a formal symbolic substrate**:
- symbols as geometric carriers
- not as meaning or interpretation
- not as experiential language

UTL functions here as a **coordination geometry**, not a semantic system.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This LDSF:
- ✔ treats symbols as physical/structural signals
- ✔ remains non-experiential
- ✔ remains falsifiable

This LDSF does **not**:
- ✖ assert meaning
- ✖ assert consciousness
- ✖ enter LDF or LC

---

## Legacy Mapping Note

In UCC versions ≤ 2.5.0, symbolic coordination appeared under **LD8–LD9**.

They now map cleanly to:
- **LD8 → LDSF3**
- **LD9 (shared signaling only) → LDSF3**

---

## Falsifiability

This classification must be revised if:
- symbolic systems cease to enable coordination,
- alignment fails replication,
- or coordination becomes observer-dependent.
