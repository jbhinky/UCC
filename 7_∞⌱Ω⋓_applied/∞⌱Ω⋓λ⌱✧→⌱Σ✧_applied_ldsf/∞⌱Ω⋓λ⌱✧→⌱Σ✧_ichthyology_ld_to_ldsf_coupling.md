# Ichthyology — LD → LDSF Coupling

## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the **LD5 coupling boundary** at which **LD1–LD4 structural processes** governing fish biology transition into a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

The coupling described here is **descriptive, not theoretical**, and is grounded exclusively in measurable biological and environmental criteria.

---

## 2. LD Preconditions (Structural Layer)

Ichthyological systems operate on LD foundations that include:

- **LD1 — Atomic / Molecular**
  - ionic gradients across membranes (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺)
  - oxygen binding and transport chemistry (hemoglobin/myoglobin variants)
  - enzymatic kinetics governing metabolism

- **LD2 — Biochemical / Physiological**
  - osmoregulation across salinity gradients
  - endocrine regulation of growth and reproduction
  - neural and muscular signal transduction

- **LD3 — Organism-Level Dynamics**
  - metabolic rate scaling with temperature and body mass
  - energy allocation to growth, maintenance, and reproduction
  - locomotion and buoyancy regulation

- **LD4 — Spatial–Temporal Structure**
  - habitat geometry (benthic, pelagic, littoral, riverine)
  - seasonal and interannual environmental variability
  - connectivity of spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds

These LD processes are **necessary but not sufficient** for LDSF classification.

---

## 3. Coupling Condition (LD5 Activation)

LD → LDSF coupling occurs when **structural biological processes become externally measurable as shared population-level fields**.

For ichthyology, LD5 is activated when all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Population Aggregation**
   - individuals form measurable populations with definable boundaries
   - abundance or biomass can be estimated across space

2. **Shared Temporal Structure**
   - life-history timing (spawning, recruitment, migration) shows reproducible seasonal or interannual patterns

3. **Environmental Coupling**
   - population metrics correlate with shared external drivers  
     (temperature, oxygen, productivity, salinity, flow)

4. **Observer-Independent Measurement**
   - independent institutions using standardized methods produce comparable results

When these criteria are satisfied, the system transitions from LD-only description to **LDSF1–LDSF2** classification.

---

## 4. LDSF Outputs (What Becomes Measurable)

After LD5 coupling, the following variables become valid shared-field observables:

- population abundance or density
- biomass estimates (e.g., kg·km⁻² or total stock biomass)
- age and size structure
- recruitment indices
- natural and fishing mortality rates
- migration timing and routes
- habitat occupancy and range shifts

These variables persist **beyond individual organisms** and remain measurable across observers and time.

---

## 5. Boundary Conditions

This coupling:
- ✔ does **not** imply cognition or selfhood
- ✔ does **not** assign ethical status
- ✔ does **not** depend on symbolic interpretation

It is strictly a **structural-to-empirical transition** defined by measurability and reproducibility.

---

## 6. Falsifiability

The LD → LDSF coupling for ichthyology must be rejected if:

- fish populations cannot be independently measured,
- shared temporal patterns fail replication,
- or population metrics collapse into non-comparable, individual-only observations.

No reinterpretation beyond these conditions is permitted.
