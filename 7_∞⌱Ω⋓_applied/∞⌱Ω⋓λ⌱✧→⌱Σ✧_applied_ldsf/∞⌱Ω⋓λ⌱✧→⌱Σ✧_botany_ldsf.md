# Botany — LDSF

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This document defines **botany** as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)** within **UCC v2.5.1**.

Here, botany (LDSF) refers to **shared, external coordination fields generated by plant systems**, including:

- primary production (photosynthesis at scale)
- phenological timing (leaf-out, flowering, senescence)
- plant–soil–atmosphere coupling
- landscape-scale vegetation structure
- trophic and climatic mediation by plant communities

This file introduces:
- **no internal selfhood**
- **no subjective experience**
- **no ethical interpretation**

---

## 2. Layer Placement

### Correct Layer
- **LDSF1** (shared plant-mediated coordination fields)

### Explicitly Not
- ❌ LD (pure molecular or physical structure)
- ❌ LDF (internal experience or selfhood)
- ❌ LC (ethics, philosophy, interfaith)

---

## 3. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In legacy UCC versions (≤2.5.0), plant-mediated shared phenomena were embedded across **LD6–LD7** on the shared LD map.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, plant systems acting as shared coordination fields are explicitly classified as **LDSF**, with **LD5 serving as the union operator** between LD (structure) and LDSF (shared environmental coordination).  
>  
> This file operates at **LDSF1**, corresponding most closely to **legacy LD6**.

---

## 4. LD Lineage (Structural Parentage)

Botanical shared fields arise from LD foundations including:

- **LD1** — molecular structure (carbon chemistry, water, pigments)
- **LD2** — biochemical pathways (photosynthesis, respiration)
- **LD3** — thermodynamics of open systems (energy capture and dissipation)
- **LD4** — planetary cycles (solar input, seasons, hydrology)

Plants do not introduce new physical law; they **stabilize and propagate energy flows** across space and time.

---

## 5. Definition of Botany as LDSF

Within UCC, botany qualifies as **LDSF** when it is treated as:

> **A shared, externally observable coordination field produced by plant populations that regulate energy, matter, and timing across landscapes and ecosystems.**

This includes:
- canopy formation and albedo modulation
- transpiration and atmospheric moisture coupling
- carbon sequestration at scale
- seasonal synchronization across species
- soil stabilization and nutrient cycling

These processes are **collective**, **external**, and **measurable**.

---

## 6. Shared-Field Characteristics

Botany (LDSF) exhibits the defining properties of shared fields:

### 6.1 Externality
Plant-mediated effects operate independently of any single organism.

### 6.2 Collective Coordination
Plant populations synchronize:
- growing seasons
- flowering windows
- resource availability
- habitat structure

### 6.3 Temporal Persistence
Botanical patterns persist across:
- annual cycles
- successional stages
- climatic epochs

### 6.4 Reproducible Observability
Botanical shared fields are measured using:
- remote sensing (NDVI, EVI)
- phenological records
- biomass inventories
- flux tower measurements

---

## 7. Functional Domains (Shared Botany)

This LDSF file includes only **shared plant-system domains**, such as:

- **primary productivity**
- **phenology**
- **vegetation structure**
- **land–atmosphere exchange**
- **plant-mediated ecosystem engineering**

It explicitly excludes:
- neural processing
- subjective awareness
- symbolic representation

---

## 8. Boundaries and Non-Claims

This file does **not** claim that plants possess:
- consciousness
- selfhood
- intentional meaning

All coordination arises from:
- physical constraints
- biochemical signaling
- evolutionary selection

---

## 9. Relation to Other LDSF Fields

Botany (LDSF) interfaces directly with:

- `atmospheric_systems_ldsf`
- `biology_ldsf`
- `ecology_ldsf`
- `oceanic_systems_ldsf`
- `soil_systems_ldsf` (if defined)

Botany acts as a **primary mediator** between physical environment and living systems.

---

## 10. Coupling Status

- **LD → LDSF coupling**: REQUIRED  
  (addressed in a dedicated coupling file)

- **LDSF → LDF coupling**: CONDITIONAL  
  Botanical systems may contribute **preconditions** for selfhood in other organisms but do not internalize directly.

---

## 11. Falsifiability and Revision

This file must be revised if:

- plant systems are shown not to coordinate environments at shared scales,
- primary productivity fails as a measurable shared field,
- or plant-mediated environmental regulation is invalidated.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
