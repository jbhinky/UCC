# Atmospheric Systems — LD → LDSF Coupling

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **structural coupling** by which **atmospheric phenomena**, fully defined within **LD (Light Dimensions)**, become classified as a **Light Dimension Shared Field (LDSF)**.

This file:
- introduces **no new physics**
- introduces **no agency or awareness**
- describes **transition of classification**, not causation

---

## 2. Legacy Mapping Note (UCC ≤ 2.5.0)

> **Legacy Mapping Clarification**  
> In UCC versions ≤2.5.0, atmospheric phenomena were implicitly grouped within **LD6 (shared physical domains)**.  
>  
> As of **UCC 2.5.1**, shared domains are explicitly separated as **LDSF**, with **LD5 functioning as the union operator** between LD (structure) and LDSF (shared coordination fields).

---

## 3. LD Foundations (Pre-Coupling State)

Atmospheric systems originate entirely within LD:

- **LD1** — molecular motion and collision dynamics  
- **LD2** — gas-phase chemistry and radiative absorption  
- **LD3** — thermodynamic gradients and phase transitions  
- **LD4** — planetary gravity, rotation, solar forcing, and orbital stability  

At this stage:
- atmospheric processes are **structural**
- interactions are **local**
- no shared-field designation applies

---

## 4. LD5 — Planetary Union Operator

The transition from LD to LDSF occurs through **LD5**, defined as:

> **The operator that binds LD4 planetary-scale structure into a globally shared spatial–temporal coordinate frame.**

LD5 is **not a dimension**.  
It performs no dynamics.

LD5 establishes:
- common gravity vector
- shared vertical (pressure) gradient
- global horizontal reference (latitude/longitude)
- shared diurnal and seasonal timing

---

## 5. Coupling Condition: Structural to Shared

Atmospheric phenomena qualify as **LDSF** when all of the following are true:

1. **Spatial coherence**  
   Processes extend beyond local interaction and influence planetary-scale regions.

2. **Temporal persistence**  
   Patterns persist across time scales longer than local molecular interactions.

3. **Simultaneity of influence**  
   Multiple independent systems experience the same atmospheric constraints concurrently.

4. **Externality**  
   Processes operate independently of organisms, perception, or interpretation.

When these conditions are met, LD processes become **shared coordination fields**.

---

## 6. Resulting Classification

After LD5 coupling:

- Atmospheric structure remains governed by LD laws
- Classification shifts to **LDSF1** due to:
  - shared reach
  - external constraint
  - planetary coordination

No new properties are introduced.

---

## 7. What This Coupling Does *Not* Do

This coupling does **not**:

- create intention or agency  
- introduce awareness or observation  
- internalize experience  
- generate meaning or ethics  

All such properties arise **only** in later LDF or LC layers.

---

## 8. Relation to Other LDSF Fields

This coupling enables downstream LDSF fields including:

- `ecology_ldsf`
- `oceanic_systems_ldsf`
- `botany_ldsf`
- `biology_ldsf`
- `civilization_ldsf`

Atmospheric systems act as a **baseline shared constraint**, not a specialized field.

---

## 9. Falsifiability and Revision

This coupling must be revised if:

- atmospheric dynamics are shown to require internal agency,
- planetary-scale atmospheric coordination is disproven,
- or LD4 planetary stability is invalidated.

No retroactive reinterpretation is permitted.
