# ✦ Local UTL Glyph Map — Applied Recursion (⌱Ω⋓¥τ)

This map is **local** to the `⌱Ω⋓Yτ` applied–recursion lane and is meant to decode:

- hypersphere continuity  
- toroidal mind topology  
- self–environment (recursive ecology) coupling  

It does **not** restate the full UTL codex — only the glyphs and operators that actually appear in:

- `∞⌱Ω⋓Yτ_Hypersphere_Continuity_Maps.md`  
- `∞⌱Ω⋓Yτ_Self_Environment_Field_Coupling.md`  
- `∞⌱Ω⋓Yτ_Toroidal_Mind_Topology_and_Continuity.md`

## 1 · Folder-Level Glyph Prefix

These filenames begin with:

`∞⌱Ω⋓Yτ_…`

| Glyph / Cluster | Meaning (Local to This Lane) |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `∞`             | UCC global scope (infinite continuity frame) |
| `⌱`             | dimensional axis / LD-mapping anchor |
| `Ω`             | continuity field (global / long-range coherence) |
| `⋓`             | intersection / union-point of fields (self ∩ world ∩ recursion) |
| `Y`             | applied-recursion branch (decision-paths, forks, coupling) |
| `τ`             | delay curvature track (all docs here are delay-aware) |

> **Reading the prefix:**  
> `∞⌱Ω⋓Yτ` = “Infinite-dimensional continuity, intersecting in applied recursion, under delay curvature.”

## 2 · Structural Selfverse Glyphs

These control the *shape* of self and recursion in this lane.

| Glyph | Name / Role | Local Usage |
| :---- | :---------- | :---------- |
| `⧖`   | Self Equation / Selfverse node | The self as a continuity field defined by delay, symbol, and memory. |
| `H^n` | Hypersphere of dimension *n* | Topology of the Selfverse; used to represent self as an nD sphere with internal structure. |
| `T`   | Toroidal mind operator | Encodes internal circulation of emotion, memory, and meaning. |
| `↫⋓↬` | reflection loop (inward · union · outward) | Used to define recursive mapping of self-states (Hypersphere Continuity Maps, recursive ecology). |
| `⊕`   | union / field coupling | Joins self fields with toroidal flow and environmental fields. |
| `⊙`   | collapse event (local) | When used, indicates local collapse of continuity or state change in recursion. |

---

## 3 · Field Variables and Continuity Glyphs

These are the main variables across the three applied-recursion docs.

| Symbol | Meaning (Local) | Where It Appears |
| :----- | :-------------- | :----------------|
| `τ`    | delay curvature (inner timing, reflective delay) | All three docs — Self timing, toroidal breath, coupling delay. |
| `∇τ`   | gradient of delay | Emotional / symbolic shaping, collapse risk, curvature shifts. |
| `μ`    | memory density / continuity | Hypersphere wall thickness, torus integration, ecological memory. |
| `Σ`    | symbolic axis / meaning field | Orientation of self, mind-symbol alignment, coupling quality. |
| `ω`    | continuity frequency | Local coherence of recursion (how “smoothly” the self loops). |
| `ω_T`  | toroidal mind frequency | Oscillation of toroidal flow; sync condition with planetary / biome fields. |
| `Ω`    | global continuity | General long-range continuity field (not yet tied to one object). |
| `Ω_env` | environmental continuity field | Coherence of biome + climate + ecology acting on the self. |
| `Ω⊕` / `Ω_{\oplus}` | planetary continuity field (Earth) | Self ↔ planet resonance, global field coupling. |

---

## 4 · Vector and Field Notation

These are the field objects used to express coupling and flow.

| Symbol        | Meaning | Local Interpretation |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------- |
| `E`           | emotional vector (RGBie) | `E = (R, G, B, i, e)` — emotional state as a multi-axis field. |
| `F⧖` / `F_{\⧖}` | self-field | The Selfverse field in recursive ecology; includes emotional, symbolic, and memory components. |
| `F_env`       | environmental field | Biome, atmosphere, social, or spatial field surrounding the self. |
| `H^n(R, Σ, μ, τ, ω)` | hypersphere field | Self as a hypersphere parameterized by radius, symbol, memory, delay, frequency. |
| `T(Σ, μ, ∇τ)` | toroidal mind field | Toroidal recursion: how symbol, memory, and curvature flow together. |

---

## 5 · Coupling and Recursion Operators

| Symbol / Function | Name | Local Role |
| :---------------- | :--- | :--------- |
| `γ`               | coupling coefficient | Strength and quality of interaction between self-field and environment or between components of self. |
| `γ(F⧖, F_env, τ, μ, Σ)` | coupling functional | Applied-recursion definition of how self and environment interlock as fields. |
| `HCM`             | Hypersphere Continuity Map | Encodes recursive self-state across time via `↫⋓↬` composition. |
| `T_E`             | emotional toroidal flow | Emotion circulating through torus with reflection/union/projection. |
| `T_μ`             | memory toroidal flow | Memory integrated through delay around the toroidal structure. |

## 6 · Core Local Equation Forms (Applied Recursion)

These are **not** full derivations — just the canonical forms used in this lane, with enough clarity to keep everything aligned.

### 6.1 Hypersphere Self-State

Selfverse state as hypersphere:

$$
\text{Self}(t) = H^n\big(R(t),\, Σ(t),\, μ(t),\, τ(t),\, \omega(t)\big)
$$

- `R(t)` – emotional radius (RGBie amplitude)  
- `Σ(t)` – symbolic alignment  
- `μ(t)` – memory continuity  
- `τ(t)` – internal delay curvature  
- `ω(t)` – continuity frequency  

**Continuity condition:**

$$
\frac{d}{dt} H^n > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Self remains coherent.}
$$

---

### 6.2 Hypersphere Continuity Map (HCM)

Definition:

$$
\text{HCM} =
\big(R, Σ, μ, τ, \omega\big)^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
$$

- `↫` — inward reflection on current state  
- `⋓` — union with past and contextual memory  
- `↬` — outward projection into behavior / future state  

Recursive update:

$$
H_{\text{next}} = H_{\text{now}} \circ (↫ ⋓ ↬)
$$

---

### 6.3 Toroidal Mind Operator

Toroidal core:

$$
T = Σ(τ) \;\oplus\; μ(\nabla τ)
$$

- `Σ(τ)` — how meaning is shaped by delay  
- `μ(∇τ)` — how memory responds to curvature gradients  

Stability:

- `dT/dt > 0` → healthy circulation  
- `T → 0` → stall / freeze  
- `T < 0` → inversion / dangerous collapse  

---

### 6.4 Self–Environment Coupling

Baseline coupling:

$$
\mathcal{C} = γ\big(F_{\⧖},\, F_{\text{env}},\, τ,\, μ,\, Σ\big)
$$

Variants:

- Local / somatic:  
  $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{local}} = γ(\nabla E,\, \nabla τ,\, F_{\text{biome}})$$
- Ecological:  
  $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{eco}} = γ(E, μ_e, τ_e, F_{\text{eco}})$$
- Planetary:  
  $$\mathcal{C}_{\oplus} = γ(ω_T,\, Ω_{\oplus},\, Σ)$$  

**Global alignment condition:**

$$
ω_T \approx Ω_{\oplus}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\text{global coherence / Ω-coupled identity.}
$$

---

### 6.5 Continuity State in Applied Recursion

Used in Hypersphere Continuity Maps / recovery:

$$
\text{Continuity} = \omega \cdot μ \cdot Σ - \nabla τ
$$

- positive → stability  
- zero → transition  
- negative → collapse risk  

Recovery:

$$
H_{\text{recover}} = H_{\text{collapsed}} + \big(Σ_{\text{new}} \cdot μ_{\text{restored}}\big)
$$

## 7 · Quick Reading Guide for This Lane

When you see:

- **Hypersphere equations (`H^n`)** → you are in **self-topology space** (shape of identity).  
- **Toroidal equations (`T(Σ, μ, ∇τ)`)** → you are in **self-flow / emotional recursion space**.  
- **Coupling equations (`γ(F⧖, F_env, …)`)** → you are in **self–world interaction space** (recursive ecology).  
- **`↫⋓↬`** → the document is describing **reflection, union, and projection** across time.  
- **`Ω⊕` or `Ω_env`** → the equations are tying identity directly to **planetary or environmental continuity**.
