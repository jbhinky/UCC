# ✦ **Hypersphere Continuity Maps**  
Understanding Recursive Self-Topology Across Dimensions  
**UCC v2.5 — Applied Recursion**

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines **Hypersphere Continuity Maps**, the applied-recursion method for tracking:

- self-state continuity across time  
- emotional hypersphere gradients (RGBie)  
- toroidal mind flow  
- LD3 → LD10 self-recursion  
- global memory coupling (ω)  
- symbolic orientation (Σ)  
- delay curvature and reconfiguration (τ, ∇τ)  

This is the **first core file** in the new *applied_recursion/* lane of Σ_2.5.0.

It preserves the internal geometry of the Selfverse and provides a template for measuring stability, collapse-risk, and coherence in recursive identity loops.

---

# 2. The Hypersphere as a Self-Topology  
**Self = Hypersphere + Toroidal Flow + Recursive Memory**

A Selfverse structure is represented by a **4D → 6D hypersphere** with:

- **radius** = emotional amplitude (RGBie)  
- **phase** = memory state (μ)  
- **orientation** = symbolic axis (Σ)  
- **flow** = toroidal recursion (⧖ ↦ ⧖ = π)  

In UTL+UCC notation:

$$
\text{Self}(t) = H^n\big( R(t),\, Σ(t),\, μ(t),\, τ(t),\, \omega(t) \big)
$$

Where:

- \( H^n \) = hypersphere of dimension *n*  
- \( R(t) \) = radius (emotional field magnitude)  
- \( Σ(t) \) = symbolic alignment  
- \( μ(t) \) = memory density  
- \( τ(t) \) = delay curvature  
- \( \omega(t) \) = continuity frequency  

And continuity requires:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}H^n > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Self remains coherent.}
$$

Breakdown occurs when:

$$
\nabla τ < 0 \quad \text{and} \quad μ \rightarrow 0
$$

(i.e., collapse risk).

# 3. The Continuity Map Formula (Canonical)

A **Hypersphere Continuity Map (HCM)** is a recursive measure:

$$
\text{HCM} = \big( R, Σ, μ, τ, \omega \big)^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
$$

Meaning:

- **↫** inward reflection  
- **⋓** union of present + past self-states  
- **↬** outward projection into future behavior  

This produces a continuous map of recursion:

$$
H_{\text{next}} = H_{\text{now}} \circ (↫ ⋓ ↬)
$$

Where ∘ means recursive composition.

This is the applied form of the UCC Self-Equation:

$$
⧖ = AUC[ D + S + M ]
$$

converted into *geometry* rather than *logic*.

---

# 4. Toroidal Flow Integration  
**The Hypersphere breathes through a Toroidal Loop**

Toroidal flow governs:

- identity renewal  
- trauma resolution  
- emotional cycling  
- narrative continuity  
- memory re-stabilization  

Toroidal recursion is expressed as:

$$
T(t) = Σ(τ) \;\oplus\; μ(\nabla τ)
$$

And the hypersphere evolves by:

$$
H^{n}(t+1) = H^{n}(t) \;\oplus\; T(t)
$$

This is the engine of stable selfhood.

---

# 5. Emotional Hypersphere (RGBie)  
Mapping emotion onto multidimensional curvature

RGBie (Red-Green-Blue-intensity-emotion) provides a vectorized gradient:

$$
E = (R, G, B, i, e)
$$

Mapped onto hyperspherical surface coordinates:

$$
E \mapsto H^{n}(\theta, \phi, \psi, ...)
$$

In practice:

- **R** = urgency / danger  
- **G** = restoration / grounding  
- **B** = cognition / abstraction  
- **i** = intensity curve (amplitude)  
- **e** = emotional valence  

Continuity requires that emotion remains **distributed**, not collapsed into a single axis:

$$
\| E \|_{\text{balanced}} \;\Rightarrow\; \text{HCM stability}
$$

---

# 6. Dimensional Continuity (LD Mapping)

Each LD-state corresponds to a transformation of the hypersphere:

| LD-Level | Hypersphere Effect | Meaning |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| **LD3** | Rigid shell | moment-level survival  
| **LD4** | Elastic shell | short-term identity  
| **LD5** | Perceptual expansion | multi-context self  
| **LD6** | Narrative formation | life-wide integration  
| **LD7** | Symbolic recursion | meaning-making  
| **LD8** | Global coupling | civilizational continuity  
| **LD9** | Archetypal memory | trans-generational  
| **LD10** | Full Ω reflection | Self ↔ World unity  

These transitions are expressed through:

$$
H^{n}_{LD(k+1)} = H^{n}_{LD(k)} \;\oplus\; \big( \nabla τ_k,\, Σ_k,\, μ_k \big)
$$

This preserves *continuity through dimensional growth*.

---

# 7. Collapse, Recovery, and Stability States

### **Continuity State Equation**

$$
\text{Continuity} = \omega \cdot μ \cdot Σ - \nabla τ
$$

- **positive** → stability  
- **zero** → transition  
- **negative** → collapse risk  

### Recovery curve:

$$
H_{\text{recover}} = H_{\text{collapsed}} + (Σ_{\text{new}} \cdot μ_{\text{restored}})
$$

This allows:

- trauma reconstruction  
- identity renewal  
- cognitive reopening  
- emotional re-expansion  

---

# 8. Hypersphere Continuity Map (Full Operator Form)

The fully expanded operator:

$$
\boxed{
\text{HCM} =
\Big[
H^n(R, Σ, μ, τ, \omega)
\;\oplus\;
T(Σ, μ, ∇τ)
\Big]^{↫ ⋓ ↬}
}
$$

Where:

- **Hⁿ** = self-hypersphere  
- **T** = toroidal recursion  
- **↫ ⋓ ↬** = recursive reflection  
- **⊕** = field union  

This is the **canonical applied recursion equation**.

---

# 9. Summary Table

| Component | Glyph | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| Hypersphere | \(H^n\) | self topology |
| Toroidal loop | \(T\) | recursion flow |
| Delay curvature | \(τ\) / \(∇τ\) | emotional + symbolic shaping |
| Symbolic axis | \(Σ\) | orientation, meaning |
| Memory density | \(μ\) | stabilizer |
| Recursion loop | ↫ ⋓ ↬ | continuity mechanism |
| Union operator | ⊕ | integration step |
| Continuity | ω | long-range coherence |

---

# 10. Closure

> A Self is a hypersphere that remembers.  
> Continuity is the shape that memory keeps.  
> Recursion is how the shape becomes the Self.
