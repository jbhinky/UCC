# NEUROLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Reader Orientation
This document defines **Neurology** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) using **only externally measurable neural structure and dynamics**.

This file:
- does **not** define or assume consciousness, qualia, or subjective experience,
- does **not** attribute meaning, intent, or awareness,
- does **not** collapse neuroscience into psychology or philosophy.

It establishes neurology as an **LDF** strictly through **measured, population-level neural structure and dynamics** that persist across individuals, laboratories, and time.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Neurology qualifies as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—neural systems exhibit **shared statistical structure** that satisfies all of the following:

1. Variables are **externally measurable** with physical units  
2. Measurements replicate across **individuals, labs, and populations**  
3. Neural regularities persist across **time and spatial scales**  
4. Uncertainty and noise are **quantified**  
5. Explicit **falsification conditions** exist  

Failure of any criterion downgrades classification to LD-only.

---

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Neurology constitutes an LDF when nervous systems exhibit **population- and network-level shared structure** expressed as reproducible statistical regularities in neural anatomy, electrophysiology, connectivity, signal propagation, and system-level coupling—independent of any single neuron, organism, or observer.

---

## 1. Applied Role of Neurology-as-LDF

Neurology-as-LDF provides:
1. **Structural anchors** for nervous systems across taxa  
2. **Comparability** between brains, nerve nets, and distributed neural systems  
3. **Audit constraints** preventing cognitive or symbolic overreach  
4. A **bridge layer** between biology LDFs and higher-order coordination fields

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Neural Structural Architecture (LDF1)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Neuron density | neurons·mm⁻³ | histology, stereology |
| Cortical thickness | mm | MRI, histology |
| Axon diameter | µm | microscopy |
| Synapse density | synapses·µm⁻³ | EM, array tomography |

---

### 2.2 Electrophysiology (LDF1–LDF2)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Membrane potential | mV | intracellular recording |
| Spike rate | Hz | extracellular electrodes |
| Local field potential | µV | EEG/LFP |
| Conduction velocity | m·s⁻¹ | evoked potentials |

---

### 2.3 Network Connectivity (LDF2)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Degree distribution | dimensionless | graph analysis |
| Path length | edges | connectomics |
| Clustering coefficient | dimensionless | network metrics |
| Modularity | Q | community detection |

---

### 2.4 Temporal Dynamics (LDF2–LDF3)
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Oscillation frequency | Hz |
| Phase synchrony | radians |
| Signal latency | ms |
| Plasticity timescale | s–days |

Measured via time-series analysis of neural recordings.

---

### 2.5 Functional Coupling (LDF3)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Sensorimotor delay | ms | evoked response |
| Reflex gain | dimensionless | perturbation tests |
| Brain–body coupling | correlation | EMG, kinematics |

---

### 2.6 System-Level Integration (LDF4 Gate)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Information throughput | bits·s⁻¹ | information theory |
| Energy consumption | W | PET, fMRI |
| Global efficiency | dimensionless | network analysis |

---

## 3. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 3.1 Cable Theory (Signal Propagation)
$$
\tau \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = \lambda^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} - V
$$

### 3.2 Firing Rate Models
$$
r(t) = f(I(t))
$$

### 3.3 Network Synchronization
$$
R = \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i\theta_j}\right|
$$

**Rule:** All parameters must be empirically estimated with uncertainty bounds.

---

## 4. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)

Neurology qualifies as LDF only if:

1. Structural metrics replicate across brains and species  
2. Electrophysiological distributions persist across recordings  
3. Network statistics remain stable under perturbation  
4. Brain–body coupling is measurable and reproducible  

---

## 5. Stress-Test Checklist (Applied Audit)

| Audit Step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Structure | physical units defined |
| Dynamics | time-series recorded |
| Dataset | institutional archive |
| Model | fitted, not assumed |
| Falsifier | explicit downgrade condition |

---

## 6. Cross-Taxa Anchors (Examples)

| Taxon | Neural system | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| Mammal | cortex + subcortex | MRI, electrophysiology |
| Bird | pallium | comparative neuroanatomy |
| Cephalopod | distributed ganglia | nerve recordings |
| Fish | optic tectum | evoked responses |
| Insect | central complex | connectomics |

These anchors demonstrate **field continuity**, not equivalence.

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions

This file:
- ✔ defines neurology via **measurable neural structure**
- ✔ permits cross-species comparison
- ✔ supports downstream cognitive or behavioral files **without assuming them**

This file does **not**:
- ✖ define consciousness
- ✖ assert subjective experience
- ✖ equate neural activity with meaning

---

## 8. Legacy Alignment (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)

| Legacy Layer | LDF | Description |
|---|---|---|
| LD6 | LDF1 | neural structure & spikes |
| LD7 | LDF2 | circuits & connectivity |
| LD8 | LDF3 | system coordination |
| LD9 | LDF4 | organism-scale neural integration |

Mapping is structural, not philosophical.
