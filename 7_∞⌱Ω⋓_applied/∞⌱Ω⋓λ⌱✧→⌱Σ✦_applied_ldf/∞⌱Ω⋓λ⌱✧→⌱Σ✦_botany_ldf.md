# BOTANY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Botany** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF1–LDF4)** within the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** using **only externally measurable, reproducible plant structure and function**. It establishes the operational classification rule used by UCC, enumerates required variable families with units and measurement classes, specifies acceptance and falsification criteria suitable for adversarial peer review, and constrains interpretation to prevent symbolic, cognitive, or metaphysical drift.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Botany qualifies as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—plant systems exhibit **population- to ecosystem-scale shared structure** satisfying all of the following conditions:

1. Variables are externally measurable with defined units and protocols.
2. Measurements replicate across institutions, regions, and time.
3. Statistical regularities persist across spatial and temporal scales.
4. Estimates report quantified uncertainty.
5. Explicit falsification conditions are stated.

Failure of any condition downgrades the classification to **LD-only**.

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
**Applied Claim:** Botany constitutes an LDF when plant systems exhibit **observer-independent shared structure** expressed through reproducible statistical regularities in morphology, physiology, phenology, population structure, and ecosystem flux, across space and time, independent of individual plants and independent of observer identity.

---

## 1. Applied Role of Botany-as-LDF
Botany-as-LDF serves as a foundational biological field anchor for:
1. Global comparability of plant traits across taxa and biomes.
2. Quantitative vegetation structure mapping (canopy height, LAI, biomass, cover).
3. Coupling of carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes in ecosystems.
4. Downstream integration with zoology, mycology, soil science, hydrology, and climate-linked LDF/LDSF files.

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Taxonomic Identity (Mandatory)
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Species (binomial) | Stable biological identity |
| Higher taxonomy | Comparative structure |
| Functional type | Cross-system grouping |

Unnamed taxa are not permitted.

---

### 2.2 Structural Traits (LDF1)
| Trait Family | Variables | Units | Measurement Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Leaf | area, SLA, thickness | m²; m²·kg⁻¹; mm | scanning, dry mass |
| Stem | wood density, diameter | g·cm⁻³; cm | coring, calipers |
| Root | depth, SRL | m; m·g⁻¹ | excavation, imaging |
| Whole plant | height, biomass | m; kg | plots, allometry |

---

### 2.3 Physiological Function (LDF1–LDF2)
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Photosynthesis | A_max, quantum yield | µmol CO₂·m⁻²·s⁻¹ | gas exchange |
| Respiration | dark respiration | µmol CO₂·m⁻²·s⁻¹ | chambers |
| Water relations | transpiration, WUE | mmol H₂O·m⁻²·s⁻¹ | porometry |

---

### 2.4 Growth & Phenology (Temporal Structure; LDF2)
| Process | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Growth | RGR, biomass increment | g·g⁻¹·day⁻¹ |
| Phenology | budburst, flowering | day-of-year |
| Senescence | leaf fall timing | day-of-year |

Measured via field networks, validated citizen science, and satellite time series.

---

### 2.5 Population & Vegetation Structure (LDF2–LDF3)
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Density | individuals·m⁻² | plots, transects |
| Cover | % | quadrats, imagery |
| Basal area | m²·ha⁻¹ | forest inventories |
| Recruitment | individuals·area⁻¹·yr⁻¹ | cohort tracking |

---

### 2.6 Ecosystem Flux (Plant-Driven; LDF3–LDF4)
| Flux | Units | Measurement Class |
|---|---|---|
| GPP | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | eddy covariance |
| NPP | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | inventories + models |
| Respiration | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | towers, chambers |
| Nutrient uptake | g N/P·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | isotope tracing |

---

### 2.7 Evolutionary Constraint (LDF4)
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Phylogenetic distance | Shared lineage |
| Functional group | Trait clustering |
| Lineage stability | Comparative validity |

---

## 3. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 3.1 Photosynthesis–Light Response
$$
A(I) = \frac{A_{max} I}{I + K}
$$

### 3.2 Primary Productivity
$$
NPP = GPP - R
$$

### 3.3 Allometric Scaling
$$
Y = Y_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

All parameters must be empirically estimated with confidence intervals.

---

## 4. Acceptance Conditions
Botany retains LDF status only if:
1. Trait distributions replicate across independent datasets.
2. Phenological timing shows consistent climate coupling.
3. Flux estimates converge across field and remote sensing methods.
4. Population and vegetation structure remain statistically coherent at landscape scales.

---

## 5. Stress-Test Audit Protocol
Each applied claim must state: named taxa, variables with units and protocols, dataset class, model usage with uncertainty (if any), and an explicit falsifier requiring revision.

---

## 6. Species & Functional Anchors (Examples)
| Category | Species / Group | Evidence Class |
|---|---|---|
| Model plant | *Arabidopsis thaliana* | physiology, genomics |
| Temperate tree | *Quercus robur* | forest inventories |
| Boreal conifer | *Picea abies* | flux networks |
| Grass | *Poa pratensis* | trait databases |
| Crop | *Zea mays* | agronomic trials |

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions
This file defines botany strictly via **shared measurable structure**. It does not infer cognition, meaning, or moral status, and does not treat theoretical models as proof absent empirical data.
