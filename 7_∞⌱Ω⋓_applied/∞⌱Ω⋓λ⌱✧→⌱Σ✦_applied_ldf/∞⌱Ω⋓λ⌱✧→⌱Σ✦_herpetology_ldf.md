# HERPETOLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Herpetology** (Reptiles + Amphibians) as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC), using **only externally measurable biological structure**.

This file exists to:
- establish a **strict operational definition** for Herpetology-as-LDF,
- enumerate **required variable families** with units and measurement protocols,
- enforce **auditability and falsifiability** suitable for adversarial peer review,
- provide a **measurement template** for downstream reptile- and amphibian-specific LDF files.

No symbolic, cognitive, phenomenological, or metaphysical claims are permitted.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Herpetology qualifies as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—reptile and amphibian systems exhibit **population- to ecosystem-scale shared structure** satisfying all conditions below:

1. Variables are **externally measurable** with defined units.  
2. Measurements are **replicated across sites and institutions**.  
3. Statistical regularities persist **across space and time** (with explainable variation).  
4. Estimates include **quantified uncertainty**.  
5. **Explicit falsification conditions** are defined.

Failure of any condition downgrades classification to LD-only.

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Herpetology constitutes an LDF when reptile and amphibian systems exhibit reproducible, observer-independent statistical structure in morphology, physiology, life-history timing, population distributions, and environment-coupled fluxes, across spatial and temporal scales.

---

## 1. Applied Role of Herpetology-as-LDF
Herpetology-as-LDF provides:
1. **Thermal–biological field anchors** for ectothermic vertebrates,
2. **Comparability across taxa** with divergent life histories (amphibian vs reptile),
3. **Population and disease-monitoring baselines** (e.g., chytridiomycosis, range shifts),
4. **Coupling variables** for botany, hydrology, climate, and zoology LDF files.

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Taxonomic Identity (Mandatory)
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Species name (binomial) | Stable identity |
| Higher taxonomy | Comparative grouping |
| Persistent ID | Cross-dataset reconciliation |

Authoritative taxonomic backbones (e.g., Reptile Database, Amphibian Species of the World) are required.

---

### 2.2 Structural Traits
| Trait family | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body size | snout–vent length (SVL), total length | mm | calipers |
| Mass | wet mass | g | scales |
| Skin structure | thickness, permeability proxies | mm | histology / lab assays |
| Limb morphology | limb length ratios | ratios | morphometrics |

---

### 2.3 Physiological & Thermal Function
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body temperature | Tᵦ | °C | telemetry, probes |
| Metabolic rate | oxygen consumption | mL O₂·h⁻¹ | respirometry |
| Thermal tolerance | CTmin / CTmax | °C | lab assays |
| Water balance (amphibians) | evaporative loss | g·h⁻¹ | gravimetric |

---

### 2.4 Growth & Life History (Temporal Structure)
| Process | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Growth | size-at-age | mm·yr⁻¹ |
| Maturation | age/size at maturity | yr, mm |
| Reproduction | clutch size, egg size | counts, mm |
| Metamorphosis (amphibians) | timing | day-of-year |

---

### 2.5 Population Structure & Dynamics
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Density | individuals·ha⁻¹ | surveys, mark–recapture |
| Survival | annual survival probability | % |
| Recruitment | juveniles·yr⁻¹ | cohort tracking |
| Movement | dispersal distance | m, km |

---

### 2.6 Environmental Coupling
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Habitat temperature | °C | loggers |
| Moisture / hydroperiod | days, % | field sensors |
| Land-cover association | probability | GIS + surveys |
| Disease prevalence | % infected | diagnostic assays |

---

### 2.7 Evolutionary & Phylogenetic Constraint
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Phylogenetic distance | shared evolutionary history |
| Functional guild | ecological comparability |
| Lineage stability | dataset reconciliation |

---

## 3. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 3.1 Temperature–Performance Curves
Used only when fit to measured performance data:
$$
P(T) = a e^{-\frac{(T-T_{opt})^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

### 3.2 Population Growth (empirical time series)
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

### 3.3 Survival / Hazard Models
$$
S(t) = e^{-\int_0^t h(u)\,du}
$$

**Rule:** all parameters must be estimated from data with uncertainty bounds.

---

## 4. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)
Herpetology qualifies as LDF only if:
1. Trait and physiological measurements replicate across studies.  
2. Population patterns persist across sites with explainable environmental dependence.  
3. Thermal and moisture coupling is statistically demonstrable.  
4. Disease or disturbance signals are measurable and reproducible.

---

## 5. Stress-Test Checklist
| Audit step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity | Species named + taxonomic ID |
| Measurement | Units + protocol specified |
| Dataset | Institutional or international archive |
| Model | Parameters + uncertainty |
| Falsifier | Explicit downgrade trigger |

---

## 6. Species Anchors (Examples; Enforcing “Exacts”)
| Group | Species | Evidence domains |
|---|---|---|
| Amphibian | *Rana temporaria* | phenology, disease |
| Amphibian | *Ambystoma maculatum* | migration, demography |
| Reptile | *Anolis carolinensis* | thermal ecology |
| Reptile | *Testudo hermanni* | growth, life history |
| Reptile | *Crotalus atrox* | movement, population surveys |

Subspecies are used **only** when underlying datasets require them.

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions
This file:
- ✔ classifies herpetology strictly via **measurable shared structure**,
- ✔ constrains claims to externally observable biology,
- ✔ supports downstream reptile and amphibian LDF files.

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer cognition or meaning,
- ✖ anthropomorphize ectotherms,
- ✖ promote models without data.
