# LDF — Boundary Conditions & Tier Constraints (Applied)

## Purpose
This file defines the **non-negotiable boundary conditions** governing **all Applied LDF files** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

It specifies:
- **what qualifies** a domain as LDF,
- **what disqualifies** or downgrades an LDF claim,
- **tier limits** (LDF1–LDF4 only),
- **measurement, replication, and falsifiability gates**,
- **legacy alignment** with prior LD6–LD9 materials without reinterpretation.

This document is authoritative for **acceptance, audit, and downgrade decisions** across all Applied LDF domains.

---

## 0. Scope & Tier Ceiling
- **Permitted tiers:** LDF1, LDF2, LDF3, LDF4 only.
- **Prohibited claims:** Any assertion implying LDF5+ (or LD10+) is **out of scope** and invalid in Applied files.
- **Interpretive ceiling:** No claims of meaning, consciousness, intent, or symbolism are permitted in Applied LDF classification.

---

## 1. Core Qualification Rule (Global)
A domain qualifies as **LDF** if—and only if—it exhibits **shared, externally measurable structure** that:

1) is **quantified with units or validated scales**,  
2) **replicates** across independent institutions, cohorts, or regions,  
3) persists as **statistical regularity** across space and time (within uncertainty),  
4) includes **explicit uncertainty estimates**,  
5) has **clear falsification conditions**.

Failure of **any** condition requires downgrade.

---

## 2. Tier Definitions (Operational)

### 2.1 LDF1 — Replicated Individual Structure
- Unit of analysis: **individual**
- Evidence type: task performance, physiological/behavioral measures
- Requirement: **cross-lab replication** under comparable protocols
- Example classes: reaction time distributions; trait measures; task accuracy

### 2.2 LDF2 — Cohort / Subgroup Structure
- Unit of analysis: **group / cohort**
- Evidence type: age bands, clinical vs control, ecological subgroups
- Requirement: **independent cohort replication**
- Example classes: demographic contrasts; subgroup distributions

### 2.3 LDF3 — Population Structure
- Unit of analysis: **regional / national / multi-national populations**
- Evidence type: institutional surveys, registries, monitoring programs
- Requirement: **longitudinal stability + methodological continuity**
- Example classes: prevalence distributions; national monitoring datasets

### 2.4 LDF4 — System Coupling
- Unit of analysis: **measured coupling into external systems**
- Evidence type: fluxes, rates, burdens, impacts on other measured fields
- Requirement: **directionally stable, independently measurable effects**
- Example classes: ecosystem flux coupling; public health burden metrics

---

## 3. Measurement Integrity Gate
Every Applied LDF claim must declare:

| Requirement | Mandatory content |
|---|---|
| Variable | Name + definition |
| Units / scale | Physical units or validated psychometric scale |
| Method | Protocol / instrument |
| Dataset class | Institutional or governed repository |
| Uncertainty | CI / SE / posterior interval |
| Falsifier | Explicit downgrade trigger |

No implicit measurements are allowed.

---

## 4. Replication Gate
An LDF claim is **invalid** unless replication is demonstrated at the tier claimed:

- **LDF1:** ≥2 independent labs or datasets  
- **LDF2:** ≥2 independent cohorts  
- **LDF3:** ≥2 waves or jurisdictions under comparable sampling  
- **LDF4:** ≥2 independent measurement systems confirming coupling  

Replication failure forces downgrade.

---

## 5. Mathematical Usage Constraints
- **Permitted:** equations whose parameters are **fit to measured data** with uncertainty.
- **Prohibited:** equations presented as explanatory truth without empirical fit.

All models must specify:
- observed variables,
- estimation method,
- parameter uncertainty,
- goodness-of-fit or predictive check.

---

## 6. LD vs LDF Boundary (Non-Negotiable)
- **LD:** single-instance or short-window phenomena lacking population or field persistence.
- **LDF:** shared structure demonstrable across individuals and contexts.

**Rule:**  
If removal of an individual (or observer) removes the structure → **LD only**.  
If structure persists → **eligible for LDF** (subject to tier gates).

---

## 7. Downgrade & Invalidation Triggers
Immediate downgrade (or invalidation) occurs if:

1) measurements cannot be independently reproduced,  
2) uncertainty envelopes overwhelm claimed structure,  
3) datasets lose methodological continuity,  
4) effects collapse under expanded sampling,  
5) claims exceed tier ceilings (LDF1–LDF4).

Downgrades must be documented and propagated downstream.

---

## 8. Legacy Alignment (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)
Legacy materials labeled LD6–LD9 map directly as follows:

| Legacy | Applied |
|---|---|
| LD6 | LDF1 |
| LD7 | LDF2 |
| LD8 | LDF3 |
| LD9 | LDF4 |

No reinterpretation, elevation, or symbolic extension is permitted.

---

## 9. Prohibited Content (Applied Files)
The following are **explicitly disallowed** in Applied LDF files:
- claims of consciousness, selfhood, intent, meaning,
- metaphorical or symbolic causation,
- narrative explanations without measurement,
- single-study claims presented as field structure.

Such content belongs **outside** Applied LDF.

---

## 10. Audit Authority
This boundary file supersedes:
- domain-specific preferences,
- author intent,
- historical wording ambiguities.

In any conflict, **boundary conditions prevail**.
