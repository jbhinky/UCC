# ICHTHYOLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Ichthyology (Fishes)** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) using **only externally measurable biological structure**.

It provides:
- a **strict operational claim** for fish systems as LDF,
- the **required variable families** with units and measurement classes,
- **acceptance and audit conditions** suitable for adversarial peer review,
- **boundary conditions** preventing interpretive or cognitive drift.

No symbolic, cognitive, phenomenological, or metaphysical claims are permitted.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Ichthyology qualifies as an **Applied LDF (LDF1–LDF4)** if—and only if—fish systems exhibit **population- to ecosystem-scale shared structure** such that:

1. Variables are **externally measurable** with units and standardized protocols.  
2. Measurements are **replicated across institutions, regions, and time**.  
3. Statistical structure persists beyond individual organisms (field-level).  
4. Estimates include **quantified uncertainty**.  
5. Explicit **falsification conditions** exist.

Failure of any criterion downgrades the claim to LD-only.

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Ichthyology constitutes an LDF when fish populations and assemblages exhibit **shared, reproducible structure** in morphology, physiology, life history, abundance, movement, and ecosystem flux across space and time, **independent of individual fish and independent of observer identity**.

---

## 1. Applied Role of Ichthyology-as-LDF
Ichthyology-as-LDF functions as a foundational biological field for:

1. **Aquatic population structure and dynamics** (freshwater and marine).  
2. **Fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent assessments**.  
3. **Movement and migration coupling** (diadromous, pelagic, reef-associated systems).  
4. **Trophic and biogeochemical coupling** in aquatic ecosystems.  
5. Downstream linkage to **marine ecology, limnology, herpetology (amphibian overlap), and conservation LDF files**.

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Taxonomic Identity (Mandatory)
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Species (binomial) | Stable biological identity |
| Higher taxonomy | Comparative structure |
| Stock / ESU / management unit | Required when dataset defines them |

Unnamed or taxonomically unresolved records cannot support LDF claims.

---

### 2.2 Structural & Morphological Traits
| Trait family | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body size | total length, fork length | cm | boards, imaging |
| Mass | wet mass | g, kg | scales |
| Shape | length–mass ratio | dimensionless | morphometrics |
| Age structure | otolith age | years | otolith reading |

---

### 2.3 Physiological Constraints
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metabolism | oxygen consumption | mg O₂·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ | respirometry |
| Thermal limits | CTmin, CTmax | °C | experimental assays |
| Salinity tolerance | survival/performance | PSU | lab trials |
| Growth efficiency | FCR, growth rate | dimensionless / day⁻¹ | aquaculture & field |

---

### 2.4 Life History & Demography
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Growth rate | cm·yr⁻¹ | mark–recapture, otoliths |
| Mortality | yr⁻¹ | catch curves |
| Fecundity | eggs·female⁻¹ | dissection, imaging |
| Recruitment | individuals·area⁻¹·yr⁻¹ | surveys, larval indices |

---

### 2.5 Population & Assemblage Structure
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Abundance | N, density | individuals·km⁻² | surveys |
| Biomass | kg·km⁻² | trawl/acoustic |
| Species richness | count | standardized sampling |
| Evenness | index | assemblage analysis |

---

### 2.6 Movement & Migration (Spatial Coupling)
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Migration timing | date / DOY | telemetry, tagging |
| Movement distance | km | telemetry |
| Habitat use | proportion of time | tagging, surveys |
| Connectivity | passage rates | dams, corridors |

---

### 2.7 Ecosystem Coupling (Fish-Driven Flux)
| Flux | Units | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Trophic transfer | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | food web coupling |
| Nutrient excretion | g N/P·area⁻¹·yr⁻¹ | biogeochemical cycling |
| Biomass removal | kg·yr⁻¹ | fisheries extraction |

---

## 3. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 3.1 Length–Weight Relationship
$$
W = aL^b
$$
Parameters $a,b$ must be empirically estimated with confidence intervals.

---

### 3.2 Growth (von Bertalanffy)
$$
L(t) = L_\infty (1 - e^{-k(t-t_0)})
$$

Used only when parameters are fit to measured age–length data.

---

### 3.3 Population Dynamics
$$
N_{t+1} = N_t \lambda_t
$$
or, where justified:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

---

### 3.4 Fisheries Mortality (Catch Curves)
$$
Z = M + F
$$
Where total mortality $Z$ is estimated from age structure.

---

## 4. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)
Ichthyology qualifies as LDF only if:

1. Population and trait estimates replicate across surveys or programs.  
2. Growth and mortality parameters converge across methods (within uncertainty).  
3. Movement patterns are reproducible across tagging cohorts.  
4. Assemblage structure persists statistically across space/time.  

---

## 5. Stress-Test Checklist
| Audit step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity | Species/stock explicitly defined |
| Measurement | Units + protocol stated |
| Dataset | Institutional or international repository |
| Model | Parameters + uncertainty |
| Falsifier | Explicit downgrade condition |

---

## 6. Species / Stock Anchors (Examples)
| Domain | Species / Unit | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| Anadromous fish | *Oncorhynchus mykiss* | tagging, stock assessment |
| Marine pelagic | *Thunnus albacares* | telemetry, fisheries |
| Freshwater | *Esox lucius* | surveys, growth |
| Reef fish | *Acanthurus triostegus* | assemblage studies |
| Demersal | *Gadus morhua* | long-term assessments |

Use stocks/ESUs only when the dataset defines them.

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions
This file:
- ✔ defines ichthyology strictly via **shared measurable structure**,  
- ✔ constrains claims to population, movement, and flux data,  
- ✔ supports downstream aquatic ecology and fisheries LDF files.

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer cognition or symbolic capacity,  
- ✖ anthropomorphize fish systems,  
- ✖ treat models as proof without empirical fits.

---

## Legacy Compatibility Note (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)
Earlier corpora referencing **LD6–LD9** for aquatic biological fields map to:
**LD6–LD9 (legacy)** → **LDF1–LDF4 (current)**

All new proofs must use LDF-tier gates and falsifiers defined here.
