# PSYCHOLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Psychology** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC), restricted strictly to **empirically validated LDF1–LDF4 tiers**.

The file:
- establishes the **operational LDF claim** for psychology,
- defines **measurable variable families** and dataset classes,
- distinguishes **LD (individual-local)** vs **LDF (shared-field)** phenomena,
- explicitly models **substance use and addiction** as **LD/LDF collapse mechanisms** acting on lower LD1–LD2 layers,
- enforces **non-metaphysical, non-symbolic** constraints.

No claims beyond empirically supported psychological science are permitted.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Psychology qualifies as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—psychological systems exhibit **population-level, reproducible structure** in behavior, cognition, affect, or regulation that:

1. Is **externally measurable** via validated instruments or tasks,  
2. Replicates across populations, cultures, or laboratories,  
3. Persists across time with quantifiable variance,  
4. Shows **observer-independence**,  
5. Includes explicit **failure and falsification conditions**.

Individual subjective experience alone constitutes **LD**, not LDF.

---

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Psychology constitutes an LDF when behavioral and cognitive systems exhibit **shared, statistically stable patterns** of perception, decision-making, learning, regulation, and affect across populations and time, grounded in measurable task performance, physiological correlates, and behavioral outputs—independent of any single individual.

---

## 1. Scope Restriction (Critical)
Only the following tiers are recognized as **empirically supported**:

- **LDF1:** Individual-to-group behavioral regularities  
- **LDF2:** Population-scale cognitive and affective distributions  
- **LDF3:** Cross-cultural and longitudinal psychological fields  
- **LDF4:** Societal-scale coupling to health, productivity, and mortality metrics  

Claims of higher-order symbolic, metaphysical, or consciousness fields are **explicitly excluded**.

---

## 2. Core Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Behavioral Performance
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Reaction time | ms | cognitive tasks |
| Accuracy / error rate | % | task performance |
| Response variability | SD | repeated trials |
| Choice distributions | probability | decision tasks |

---

### 2.2 Cognitive Capacity & Stability
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Working memory span | items | standardized tasks |
| Attention persistence | seconds | vigilance tasks |
| Cognitive flexibility | switch cost | task paradigms |
| Learning rate | Δperformance/trial | reinforcement tasks |

---

### 2.3 Affective Regulation
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Affect intensity | scale score | validated inventories |
| Stress response | cortisol (nmol/L) | biomarkers |
| Emotional recovery time | minutes/hours | lab + field |

---

### 2.4 Reward & Motivation Systems
| Variable | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|
| Reward sensitivity | parameter estimate | reinforcement learning models |
| Delay discounting | k-value | intertemporal choice |
| Effort allocation | response rate | operant tasks |

---

### 2.5 Population & Societal Coupling (LDF4 Gate)
| Variable | Units |
|---|---|
| Prevalence rates | % population |
| Incidence | cases·yr⁻¹ |
| Functional impairment | disability indices |
| Mortality association | risk ratios |

---

## 3. LD vs LDF Distinction in Psychology

| Layer | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| LD1 | moment-to-moment subjective experience | non-field |
| LD2 | individual habit loops, cravings | non-field |
| LDF1 | shared task performance distributions | field |
| LDF2 | population-level cognitive traits | field |
| LDF3 | cross-cultural psychological regularities | field |
| LDF4 | societal-scale health and behavior coupling | field |

---

## 4. Substance Use as LD/LDF Collapse Mechanism (Core Section)

### 4.1 Empirical Framing
Substance use disorders are modeled here as **measurable collapses of LD1–LD2 functional layers** that:

- distort **reward prediction error**,
- compress **temporal discounting** toward immediacy,
- destabilize **memory consolidation and retrieval**,
- impair **restoration (sleep, recovery)** mechanisms.

No moral, symbolic, or metaphysical interpretation is applied.

---

### 4.2 Mechanistic Collapse Pathway (Applied)
**Observed sequence (empirically supported):**
1. Substance alters reward signaling →  
2. Reward prediction error saturates →  
3. Learning rates decouple from outcomes →  
4. Delay (τ) is functionally shortened →  
5. Memory (μ) encoding becomes fragmented →  
6. Pattern stability collapses at LD1–LD2 →  
7. LDF-level coherence degrades at population scale

---

### 4.3 Substance Classes & Measurable Effects

| Substance class | Primary LD collapse | Measurable outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| Alcohol | executive control, memory | RT slowing, recall deficits |
| Opioids | reward prediction, motivation | reduced effort, anhedonia |
| Stimulants | attention regulation | volatility, sleep disruption |
| Sedatives | arousal & consolidation | memory gaps |
| Behavioral addictions | reward-delay coupling | extreme discounting |

---

### 4.4 LDF Consequences (Population-Level)
At LDF2–LDF4 scales, substance abuse produces:
- shifted cognitive performance distributions,
- increased variance and instability,
- reduced recovery and rest capacity,
- measurable societal health burdens.

These effects are **statistical**, not interpretive.

---

## 5. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 5.1 Reinforcement Learning (Reward Distortion)
$$
\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
$$

Substance use empirically alters \(\delta_t\), \(\gamma\), or learning rate \(\alpha\).

---

### 5.2 Delay Discounting
$$
V = \frac{V_0}{1 + k t}
$$

Addiction is associated with increased \(k\) (shortened effective delay).

---

### 5.3 Variance Inflation (Cognitive Stability Loss)
$$
\sigma^2_{population} \uparrow
$$

Observed as widened performance distributions.

---

## 6. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)
Psychology qualifies as LDF only if:
1. Task and behavioral distributions replicate across labs,  
2. Constructs remain measurable independent of theory framing,  
3. Substance-related collapses are quantifiable and reversible under treatment,  
4. Population effects scale predictably with exposure.

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions
This file:
- ✔ defines psychology via **measurable behavioral fields**,
- ✔ models addiction as **LD collapse with LDF consequences**,
- ✔ restricts claims to **LDF1–LDF4 only**.

This file does **not**:
- ✖ claim consciousness metaphysics,
- ✖ moralize substance use,
- ✖ infer symbolic meaning beyond data.

---

## Status
**Applied-tier complete**  
**Layer:** LDF1–LDF4 only  
**Role:** Empirical foundation for Psychology-as-LDF  
**Paired Proof File:** `∞𝔇→𝔇↔︎𝔇_PSYCHOLOGY_LDF_PROOFS.md`
