# MAMMALS — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Mammals** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** using **only externally measurable biological structure**.

This file:
- establishes a **strict operational claim** for Mammals-as-LDF,
- defines **required variable families** with units and measurement classes,
- specifies **dataset provenance requirements** (institutional, international),
- allows **data-fit mathematical forms only** (no interpretive theory),
- provides **acceptance, audit, and falsifiability gates** suitable for adversarial peer review,
- preserves **legacy continuity** with former LD6–LD9 mappings via LDF1–LDF4.

No symbolic, cognitive, phenomenological, metaphysical, or narrative claims are permitted.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Mammals qualify as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—mammalian systems exhibit **population- to ecosystem-scale shared structure** satisfying all:

1. Variables are **externally measurable** with defined units and protocols.  
2. Measurements are **replicated across institutions and regions**.  
3. Statistical regularities are **stable across space and time** (stable ≠ constant).  
4. Estimates include **quantified uncertainty** (CI, SE, posterior interval, or measurement error).  
5. Explicit **falsification conditions** are defined.

Failure of any condition downgrades the claim to LD-only.

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Mammals constitute an LDF when mammalian systems exhibit **shared, observer-independent structure** expressed through reproducible statistical regularities in morphology, physiology, life-history traits, population dynamics, spatial movement, interaction effects, and ecosystem flux coupling, across spatial and temporal scales, independent of any single organism.

---

## 1. LDF Tiering for Mammals (LDF1–LDF4)
This applied file supports tiered classification:

- **LDF1 (Local):** single-population or site-level studies (collars, plots, herds).  
- **LDF2 (Regional):** coordinated monitoring across landscapes or jurisdictions.  
- **LDF3 (Global):** harmonized international databases and comparative syntheses.  
- **LDF4 (Coupled):** mammalian structure linked to **measured ecosystem fluxes** (carbon, nutrient transfer, trophic cascades).

Each downstream claim must explicitly state the tier satisfied.

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Taxonomic Identity (Mandatory)
| Variable | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Scientific name | binomial minimum |
| Taxon identifier | stable ID from a recognized backbone |
| Population unit | subspecies / ESU / stock only when dataset-defined |

---

### 2.2 Structural Traits
| Trait family | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Body size | mass, length | kg; m | capture, photogrammetry |
| Morphology | limb length, skull metrics | mm | calipers, imaging |
| Insulation | fur density/thickness | hairs·cm⁻²; mm | microscopy |

---

### 2.3 Physiological Function
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Metabolism | BMR, field metabolic rate | W; kJ·day⁻¹ | respirometry, doubly-labeled water |
| Thermoregulation | core body temperature | °C | telemetry |
| Reproduction | gestation length, lactation cost | days; kJ | observation, energetics |

---

### 2.4 Life History & Demography
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---:|---|
| Age at maturity | years | cohort tracking |
| Fecundity | offspring·female⁻¹·yr⁻¹ | monitoring |
| Survival | % per interval | mark–recapture |
| Longevity | years | long-term records |

---

### 2.5 Population & Spatial Structure
| Variable | Units | Method |
|---|---:|---|
| Density | individuals·km⁻² | surveys, camera traps |
| Home range | km² | GPS telemetry |
| Movement | km·day⁻¹ | collars, tags |
| Migration timing | day-of-year | tracking networks |

---

### 2.6 Interaction Structure
| Interaction | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---:|
| Predation | kill rate | events·time⁻¹ |
| Herbivory | biomass removed | g·area⁻¹·time⁻¹ |
| Competition | overlap indices | unitless |
| Social structure | group size | individuals |

---

### 2.7 Ecosystem Coupling (LDF4 Gate)
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Trophic transfer | secondary production | g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ | energetics |
| Nutrient redistribution | N/P flux via movement | g·km⁻²·yr⁻¹ | isotope / budget models |
| Vegetation feedback | browsing impact | % biomass change | exclosures |

---

## 3. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only)

### 3.1 Logistic Population Growth
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

### 3.2 Allometric Scaling
$$
Y = Y_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

### 3.3 Home-Range Scaling
$$
HR \propto M^{\beta}
$$

**Rule:** parameters must be empirically estimated with uncertainty bounds; theoretical values alone are invalid.

---

## 4. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)
Mammals qualify as LDF only if:

1. Trait and demographic distributions replicate across independent studies.  
2. Spatial and movement patterns converge across monitoring methods.  
3. Population metrics remain coherent at landscape scales.  
4. Ecosystem effects are measurable and directionally consistent when claimed.

---

## 5. Stress-Test Checklist (Applied Audit)
| Step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity | Species / population unit named |
| Measurement | Variables + units + protocol |
| Dataset | Institutional or international archive |
| Model | Parameters + uncertainty |
| Falsifier | Explicit downgrade condition |

---

## 6. Species & Population Anchors (Examples)
| Category | Species | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| Large carnivore | *Canis lupus* | telemetry, demography |
| Large herbivore | *Loxodonta africana* | movement + ecosystem impact |
| Marine mammal | *Balaenoptera musculus* | acoustics + energetics |
| Small mammal | *Peromyscus maniculatus* | population cycles |
| Primate | *Pan troglodytes* | long-term behavioral datasets |

---

## 7. Boundary Conditions
This file:
- ✔ defines mammals strictly via **shared measurable structure**,
- ✔ constrains claims to traits, populations, interactions, and flux,
- ✔ supports downstream mammalian sub-files (e.g., primates, cetaceans).

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer consciousness or moral status,
- ✖ elevate cognition to field-defining criteria,
- ✖ treat behavioral interpretation as proof.
