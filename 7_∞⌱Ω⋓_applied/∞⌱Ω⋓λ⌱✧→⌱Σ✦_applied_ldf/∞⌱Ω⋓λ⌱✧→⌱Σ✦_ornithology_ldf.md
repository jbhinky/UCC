# ORNITHOLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Ornithology** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within UCC using **only externally measurable biological structure**.

This file:
- establishes a strict **operational claim** for Ornithology-as-LDF,
- defines **required variable families** with units and measurement classes,
- specifies **dataset provenance requirements** (institutional, international),
- lists **data-fit mathematical forms only** (no interpretive theory),
- provides **acceptance, audit, and falsifiability gates** suitable for adversarial peer review,
- includes **legacy alignment** guidance (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4).

No symbolic, cognitive, phenomenological, metaphysical, or narrative claims are permitted.

---

## 0. Operational Definition (Applied)

### 0.1 LDF Qualification Criterion
Ornithology qualifies as an **Applied LDF** if—and only if—avian systems exhibit **population- to ecosystem-scale shared structure** satisfying all of the following:

1) Variables are **externally measurable** with units and protocols.  
2) Measurements replicate across **institutions / regions / nations**.  
3) Statistical regularities are **stable (not constant)** across space and time.  
4) Estimates include **quantified uncertainty**.  
5) Clear **falsification conditions** are defined.

Failure of any condition downgrades the classification to LD-only for the affected claim.

### 0.2 Applied UCC Claim
> **Applied Claim:**  
> Ornithology constitutes an LDF when bird populations exhibit **shared measurable structure** expressed through reproducible statistical regularities in morphology, physiology, phenology, movement (including migration), population dynamics, and ecosystem coupling, across spatial and temporal scales, **independent of individual birds and independent of observer identity**.

---

## 1. Applied Role of Ornithology-as-LDF
Ornithology-as-LDF functions as a **mobile biosphere field anchor** for:

1) **Global movement-linked structure** (migration timing, flyways, dispersal fields).  
2) **Trait comparability** across avian taxa (morphology, life-history, functional guilds).  
3) **Population monitoring** across scales (local colonies → continental abundance indices).  
4) **Ecosystem coupling** (seed dispersal, predation, nutrient transport, trophic effects).  
5) Downstream coupling for **zoology, epidemiology, climate-linked LDF/LDSF files**, and **conservation monitoring** under audit constraints.

---

## 2. Required Variable Families (Hard Constraints)

### 2.1 Taxonomic Identity (Mandatory)
| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| Species name (binomial) | Stable biological identity |
| Higher taxonomy (order/family) | Comparative grouping |
| Population unit (when used by dataset) | stock/colony/management unit alignment |

**Rule:** No unnamed taxa permitted. Use subspecies only if the underlying dataset uses them (e.g., management units).

---

### 2.2 Morphology & Structural Traits
| Trait family | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Body size | mass, body length | g; mm | capture/handling; museum |
| Flight morphology | wing length, wing area, aspect ratio | mm; cm²; unitless | morphometrics |
| Beak | length, depth, curvature indices | mm; unitless | calipers, imaging |
| Locomotion | tarsus length | mm | morphometrics |

---

### 2.3 Physiology & Performance
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Energetics | BMR/FMR proxies, metabolic rate | W; mL O₂·min⁻¹ | respirometry; DLW |
| Thermoregulation | body temperature; thermal limits | °C | telemetry; lab |
| Flight performance | airspeed; climb rate; endurance | m·s⁻¹; m·s⁻¹; time | radar; loggers |

---

### 2.4 Reproduction & Life History
| Variable family | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | breeding onset, clutch initiation | day-of-year |
| Output | clutch size, fledging success | eggs/nest; % |
| Survival | adult survival, juvenile survival | % / yr |
| Longevity | age distributions | years |

Measured via banding/mark–recapture, nest monitoring, long-term demography.

---

### 2.5 Phenology (Seasonal Timing Structure)
| Process | Variables | Units | Measurement class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Migration timing | departure/arrival dates | day-of-year | banding; telemetry |
| Molt timing | molt onset/offset | day-of-year | capture; observation |
| Breeding phenology | hatch date, fledging date | day-of-year | nest monitoring |

---

### 2.6 Population Dynamics & Spatial Structure
| Variable | Units | Method class |
|---|---|---|
| Abundance indices | index units; counts | surveys; point counts |
| Density | individuals·km⁻² | transects; distance sampling |
| Occupancy | probability (0–1) | occupancy models |
| Colony size (where relevant) | nests/colony | colony surveys |
| Recruitment | individuals·area⁻¹·yr⁻¹ | cohort tracking |

---

### 2.7 Movement Ecology (Key Ornithology Field Signature)
| Variable | Units | Method class |
|---|---|---|
| Home range | km² | GPS tags; KDE methods |
| Dispersal distance | km | banding/telemetry |
| Migration routes (flyways) | spatial paths | GPS / geolocators |
| Stopover duration | days | tracking + resight |
| Flight altitude (where available) | m | radar; loggers |

**Applied rule:** movement claims must specify the tracking method and error model (GPS, Argos, geolocator uncertainty).

---

### 2.8 Interaction & Coupling Effects (Measurable)
| Interaction class | Variable examples | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Predation | nest predation rate | events·nest⁻¹·time⁻¹ |
| Herbivory/granivory | seed removal rate | seeds·time⁻¹ |
| Pollination (some birds) | visitation rates | visits·time⁻¹ |
| Disease ecology | prevalence, seropositivity | % |

---

### 2.9 Ecosystem Coupling (LDF4 Gate)
| Coupling class | Measured variables | Units / methods |
|---|---|---|
| Nutrient transport | guano deposition; nutrient flux | g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |
| Seed dispersal | dispersal kernels | distance distributions |
| Trophic cascades | vegetation/arthropod response | Δbiomass; Δdensity |
| Cross-biome linkage | migratory subsidy effects | δ¹⁵N/δ¹³C shifts; budgets |

---

## 3. Dataset Provenance Requirements (Audit Gate)
An applied Ornithology LDF claim is valid only if it names:
1) **Dataset class** (survey network, banding scheme, telemetry archive, colony census program, etc.)  
2) **Measurement protocol** (units + method)  
3) **Geographic coverage** and **time range**  
4) **Uncertainty** (sampling error, detection probability, tag error)  
5) **Replication path** (second independent dataset class or independent institution)

---

## 4. Mathematical Forms (Data-Fit Only; No Interpretive Theory)

### 4.1 Population growth (auditable time series)
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

### 4.2 Survival estimation (capture–mark–recapture framing)
Let \(\phi\) be survival and \(p\) detection probability, estimated from data (model form varies by framework).
**Applied rule:** report \(\hat{\phi}\), \(\hat{p}\), and uncertainty.

### 4.3 Flight/movement scaling (empirical allometry where used)
$$
Y = Y_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

### 4.4 Migration timing as a measurable distribution
Let \(T\) be arrival date:
$$
T \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$
or an empirically estimated nonparametric distribution.

**Rule:** equations may be used only when parameters are estimated from stated datasets with confidence/credible intervals.

---

## 5. Acceptance Conditions (Applied Pass Criteria)
Ornithology qualifies as LDF (for the claim under review) only if:

1) **Trait distributions replicate** across independent datasets or institutions.  
2) **Population indices** show stable structure after accounting for detectability.  
3) **Migration timing/routes** replicate across years and cohorts within known variability bounds.  
4) **Movement ecology outputs** are consistent with tag error models and cross-method checks.  
5) **Ecosystem coupling** is measurable with directional stability (when invoked for LDF4).

---

## 6. Stress-Test Checklist (Reader-Facing)
| Audit step | Requirement | Pass evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | exact species named | taxonomy ID or authoritative checklist reference |
| Variables | units + protocols | method section present |
| Dataset | institutional / international provenance | repository or program documentation |
| Error | detection/tag uncertainty stated | CI/SE/credible intervals |
| Replication | ≥2 independent dataset classes | cross-source confirmation |
| Falsifier | explicit downgrade trigger | listed failure condition |

No step may be skipped.

---

## 7. Species & Functional Anchors (Examples; Formatting Standard)
These examples exist to enforce “exacts” formatting and prevent vague claims.

| Category | Species | Evidence class (typical) |
|---|---|---|
| Migratory passerine | *Setophaga ruticilla* (American redstart) | banding + migration timing |
| Seabird colony | *Uria aalge* (common murre) | colony demography + ecosystem coupling |
| Raptor | *Aquila chrysaetos* (golden eagle) | telemetry + survival |
| Waterfowl | *Anas platyrhynchos* (mallard) | harvest/management datasets + movement |
| Songbird model | *Taeniopygia guttata* (zebra finch) | neuroethology + vocal learning metrics |

**Applied rule:** use subspecies only when the dataset’s management or monitoring unit requires it.

---

## 8. Boundary Conditions
This file:
- ✔ defines ornithology strictly via **shared measurable structure**
- ✔ constrains claims to traits, populations, movement, and flux coupling
- ✔ provides audit gates to prevent interpretive drift

This file does **not**:
- ✖ infer cognition, meaning, or moral status
- ✖ treat a model as proof without dataset-backed parameter estimation
- ✖ claim universals beyond what measurement supports

---

## 9. Legacy Alignment (LD6–LD9 → LDF1–LDF4)
This mapping exists for continuity with older documentation:

- **LD6 → LDF1:** local measured avian dynamics (colony/site; replicable)  
- **LD7 → LDF2:** cross-bird / cross-season distributions (repeatable population structure)  
- **LD8 → LDF3:** multi-site/multi-nation harmonized monitoring (flyways, continental indices)  
- **LD9 → LDF4:** biosphere-scale coupling (nutrient transport, trophic cascades, global migratory subsidies)

Mapping only—no reinterpretation.
