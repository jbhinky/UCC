# BIOLOGY — LDF Applied Field File

## Purpose
This document defines **Biology** as an **Applied Light-Dimension Field (LDF)** within the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** using **only externally measurable, reproducible biological structure**. It establishes the operational classification rule used by UCC, enumerates the measurable variable families required for LDF status, specifies acceptance conditions under which the classification holds, and enforces boundary constraints that prevent interpretive or symbolic drift. No metaphysical, cognitive, narrative, or symbolic claims are introduced.

---

## UCC Operational Claim (Applied)
**Applied Claim:** Biology constitutes an **LDF (LDF1–LDF4)** when living systems exhibit **observer-independent, population-level and ecosystem-level shared structure**, expressed as **reproducible statistical regularities** in biological traits, population distributions, measurable interactions, and material or energetic fluxes, across space and time, independent of any single organism and independent of any single observer. This claim is operational and governs downstream biological domain files.

---

## A. Applied Role of Biology-as-LDF
Biology-as-LDF is used to standardize measurable anchors for all living systems, enable cross-scale comparability from cellular to ecosystem levels, enforce dataset traceability and auditability, and strictly separate single-instance LD observations from shared-field LDF structure.

---

## B. Minimum Variable Families Required for LDF Classification

### B1. Structural Boundedness (LDF1)
| Scale | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Cellular | cell size, volume, density | µm, µm³, cells·mL⁻¹ |
| Organismal | body mass, length, surface area | kg, m, m² |
| Tissue/Organ | mass fraction, density | %, g·cm⁻³ |

### B2. Kinetics and Rates (LDF1–LDF2)
| Process | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Growth | specific growth rate, doubling time | day⁻¹, h |
| Metabolism | respiration rate, oxygen uptake | W, mL O₂·min⁻¹ |
| Turnover | mortality rate, decay constants | yr⁻¹, day⁻¹ |

### B3. Population Field Structure (LDF2)
| Structure | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Abundance | density, biomass density | ind·km⁻², kg·km⁻² |
| Demography | fecundity, survival curves | births·ind⁻¹·yr⁻¹, % |
| Movement | dispersal distance, migration timing | km, day-of-year |

### B4. Interaction Coupling (LDF2–LDF3)
| Interaction | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Predation | attack rate, kill rate | events·time⁻¹ |
| Competition | resource depletion effect size | Δresource |
| Mutualism/Symbiosis | nutrient exchange rates | mol·time⁻¹ |

### B5. Ecosystem Flux (LDF3–LDF4)
| Flux | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Productivity | GPP, NPP | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |
| Respiration | ecosystem respiration | g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |
| Nutrient Cycling | N, P mineralization | g·m⁻²·yr⁻¹ |

### B6. Historical Constraint (LDF4)
| Constraint | Variables | Units |
|---|---|---|
| Taxonomy | accepted identifiers | IDs |
| Phylogeny | branch lengths, divergence time | substitutions/site, years |

---

## C. Mathematical Forms Permitted (Measured-Only)

### C1. Logistic Population Growth
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

### C2. Exponential Decay (Decomposition)
$$
M(t) = M_0 e^{-kt}
$$

### C3. Empirical Allometry
$$
Y = Y_0 M^{\alpha}
$$

All parameters must be empirically fit with reported uncertainty.

---

## D. Acceptance Conditions
Biology retains LDF status only if:  
1) Independent laboratories reproduce core distributions within uncertainty bounds.  
2) Patterns persist across sites with predictable variation.  
3) All claims map to traceable datasets.  
4) Field structure persists without observer dependence.

---

## E. Stress-Test Audit Protocol
Each applied biological claim must explicitly state taxa, variables with units and methods, dataset class, model usage (if any), and a falsifier that would force revision.

---

## F. Species and Subspecies Anchors (Examples)
| Domain | Species | Subspecies / Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Mammal | *Canis lupus* | *C. l. baileyi* |
| Bird | *Branta canadensis* | subspecies used when dataset requires |
| Fish | *Oncorhynchus mykiss* | ESU / run-based units |
| Plant | *Quercus robur* | provenance-based units |
| Fungus | *Armillaria ostoyae* | genet-based identification |

---

## G. Boundary Conditions
This file defines Biology strictly as an LDF through measurable shared structure. It does not infer cognition, meaning, or moral status, and does not treat theoretical models as proof absent data.
