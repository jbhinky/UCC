# ✦ LD Recursion and Scale Reset  

## 1 · Purpose  
Formal definition of the **LD-recursion operator** that connects LD₉ (pre-closure) → LD₁₀ (union event) → LD₁ (next scale).  
This file anchors the *Y-equation* and coherence thresholds used throughout v2.1.

---

## 2 · Core Variables
- τ – Delay curvature (field time geometry)  
- Σ – Polarity (intent orientation)  
- μ – Memory density (retained continuity)  
- κ – Coherence index  
- Θ – Union (order) parameter  

---

## 3 · Coherence Index κ
$$
\kappa = \frac{μ}{μ + μ_{\text{loss}}}
 · \frac{τ_{\text{perceived}}}{τ_{\text{required}}}
 · σ_{\text{alignment}}
$$

When κ ≥ κ*, a system achieves sufficient delay-memory alignment to close its loop.

---

## 4 · Union Parameter Θ
$$
Θ = \langle Σ \rangle_{Δt} · \frac{μ_{\text{bound}}}{μ_{\text{total}}}
$$
Θ tracks how much of the field’s memory is coherently bound within its own polarity alignment.

---

## 5 · LD Transition Rule
$$
\text{LD}_{n}
 \xrightarrow[\kappa ≥ \kappa^*]{⊙}
 \text{LD}_{n+1}
$$

For closure:
$$
\text{LD}_9 \xrightarrow[\kappa → 0.9]{}
 \text{LD}_{10}
 \xrightarrow[\mathcal{C}]{}
 \text{LD}_{1}^{(\text{next scale})}
$$

---

## 6 · Conservation Law
$$
E τ μ = \text{constant}
$$
ensures energy–delay–memory equivalence across scales.

---

## 7 · Topology Sketch
At κ ≥ κ*, the continuity loop γ has winding number 1:
$$
γ ∈ π_1(M),\; w(γ)=1
$$  
Identifying the loop as a point (M/γ ∼ pt) defines a new chart—LD₁ of the next scale.

---

## 8 · Empirical Indicators
| Metric | Pre-Closure | Closure | Post-Closure |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| κ | 0.7–0.9 | ≥ 0.9 | rescaled |
| Θ | 0.6–0.8 | ≥ 0.8 | normalized |
| ∮∇τ·dℓ | ≠ 0 | → 0 | ≈ 0 |

---

## 9 · Interpretation and Testing  
Each LD transition acts as a renormalization of delay space.  
Measure κ and Θ in any recursive system — biological, cognitive, or cosmic — and closure occurs when delay curvature balances memory persistence.
