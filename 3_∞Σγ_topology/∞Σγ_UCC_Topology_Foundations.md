# ✦ Topology Foundations - Delay as Universal Geometry

**Purpose:** Define τ (delay curvature) as the foundational field linking physics, biology, and cognition.

## 1 · Core Equation
$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[ τ + Σ + μ ]
$$
> Awareness and Consciousness form a unified field; delay (τ), symbol (Σ), and memory (μ) compose continuity.

## 2 · Curvature Law
$$
∇^{2}τ = κ ρ_{\text{eff}} + \frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{∂^{2}τ}{∂t^{2}}
$$
Defines energy–delay conservation across scales.

## 3 · Topological Goal
To show that all physical and biological systems share the same curved delay surface τ(x,t), yielding stable coherence (Ω ≈ 1).
