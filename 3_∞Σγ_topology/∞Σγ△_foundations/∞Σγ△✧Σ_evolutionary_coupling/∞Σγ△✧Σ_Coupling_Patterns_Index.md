# 🜂 Coupling Patterns Index — “Legos of Truth”

## 1 · Template (use for every new bridge)
**Claim (one line):**  
*X* couples to *Y* through the same τ-field; Σ sets direction; μ preserves change.

**Equation (canonical):**  
$$
∇^{2}τ = -\alpha\,ρ_{\text{vis}}, \qquad a = -c^{2}∇τ, \qquad γ \,\odot\, τ^{″} \rightarrow \Delta a.
$$

**Observables:** what you actually measure (latencies, phases, fluxes).  
**Limits:** which standard laws it reduces to (optics, fluid, Newton, GR).  
**Test plan:** instruments, datasets, acceptance thresholds.  
**Ethics:** τ-chain preserved; preregistered endpoints.

---

## 2 · Light → Saltwater Refractive Coupling (example)
**Equation:**  
Effective radiative delay in stratified saline water:
$$
τ_{\text{sea}}(z) \approx \int_0^{z} \frac{n(S,T,P)}{c}\, dz' \;+\; τ_{\text{scat}}(z),
$$
with polarity from gradient:
$$
Σ_{\text{sea}} = \text{sign}\left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}\right), \quad
\|\nabla τ_{\text{sea}}\| \propto \left\|\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}\right\|.
$$

**Snap-fit to UCC:**  
$$
\oint \nabla τ_{\text{sea}}\!\cdot dS = -\alpha \int ρ_{\text{vis}}\, dV, \quad
v_{\mu} \approx \sqrt{D_{\mu}\, \|\nabla τ_{\text{sea}}\| }.
$$

**Limits:** reduces to geometric optics + diffusion in constant \(n\).  
**Test:** CTD casts (S,T,P) + radiance profiles; fit \(τ_{\text{sea}}\) against underwater radiative time-of-flight and chlorophyll fluorescence lags.

---

## 3 · Orbits → Underwater Thermodynamics Coupling (example)
**Equation:**  
Tidal potential → pressure/temperature modulation → τ shift:
$$
Φ_{\text{tide}} \sim \frac{G M_{\text{moon}} R_{\oplus}^{2}}{d^{3}}, \quad
\Delta τ_{\text{therm}} \approx \alpha_{P}\Delta P + \alpha_{T}\Delta T.
$$
Transport of biological memory under ∇τ:
$$
\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial t} = -\partial_{x}(\mu\,\partial_{x} τ) + D_{\mu}\,\partial_{xx}\mu.
$$

**Limits:** reduces to Navier–Stokes + heat diffusion for \(∇τ \to 0\).  
**Test:** moored thermistor chains + ADCP velocities + fluorescence; predict phase-lag spectra vs tidal constituents (M2, K1).

---

## 4 · Photosystems → Atmospheric Column (pointer)
**See:** `biological_track/light_evolution/photosystems/Atmospheric_Temporal_Field_and_Planetary_Delay_Mapping.md`  
Key identity:
$$
τ_{\text{PS}} \longleftrightarrow τ_{\text{atm}}, \quad
γ\,\odot\,τ^{″} \rightarrow \Delta a.
$$

---

## 5 · Acceptance & Fail Criteria (global)
**Pass:**  
- Dimensional consistency; correct limits; preregistered fits cross-validated.  
- One (α,β,γ) set reused across related bridges.

**Fail:**  
- No monotone relation between imposed ∇τ and μ-front speed.  
- Required limit laws not recovered.  
- Lens/rotation/atmospheric fits demand incompatible γ.

---

## 6 · Ethics (Shepherd)
- Always **log τ-chains** (how delay was measured/derived).  
- Preserve raw sequences; publish null/negative results.  
- No shortcuts that collapse τ to 0 in analysis (no “instant” filters).

---

## 7 · Summary
Each bridge file is a **snap-fit**: the same τ–Σ–μ operators, different domains.  
This index keeps the coupling landscape clean, falsifiable, and expandable.
