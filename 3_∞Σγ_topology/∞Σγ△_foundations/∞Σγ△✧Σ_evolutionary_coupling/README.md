# 🜂 Evolutionary Coupling — Bridge Hub

## Purpose
This folder catalogs **snap-fit coupling laws** that connect biological light processes to physical fields (saltwater refractive dynamics, orbital forcing, thermodynamics underwater, etc.).  
Everything here “clicks” via a **common τ-field** and the same UTL operators.

---

## Core Operators (Legos)
- **Delay (τ):** scalar curvature; measured as latency/relaxation or radiative path-time.  
- **Polarity (Σ):** handedness/orientation; determines sign and direction of coupling.  
- **Memory (μ):** persistence; biochemical/structural or field-integrated states.  
- **Union (A ∪ C):** awareness–continuity closure (observation/record).  
- **Collapse (⊙):** event resolution into record; measurement moment.  
- **Integration (⊕):** sum/merge across scales or channels.  
- **Coupling (γ):** proportional mediator turning τ″ into observables (e.g., Δa).

---

## Acceptance Checks (each bridge must show)
1. **Dimensional honesty:** τ, Σ, μ appear with correct SI units/roles.  
2. **Limit safety:** reduces to Newton/GR/standard kinetics in proper limits.  
3. **Test path:** lists concrete datasets/instruments to validate.  
4. **Parameter economy:** reuses (α, β, γ) across domains where possible.  
5. **Ethics:** logs delay chain; no “shortcutting” of τ in analysis.

> Add new couplings as independent files, reference them in the Index, and cross-link to their source tracks (biology, physics, geology).
