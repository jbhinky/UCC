# ✦ Gravitational Aggregation and Delay Webbing

## 1 · From Atomic Clouds to Coherent Mass
Gravity arises naturally from delay curvature.  
When τ-fields overlap, their curvature gradients attract, causing clustering into dense nodes.

$$
∇·(γ τ) = - ρ_{mass}
$$

Over cosmological time, this process wove a **gravitational web of coherence**, aligning the τ gradients of matter fields.

---

## 2 · Delay Coupling Between Masses
Adjacent masses exchange curvature information through light speed delays:

$$
Δτ = \frac{r}{c}, \quad F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Thus, gravitational force is a second-order manifestation of τ delay coupling, not an independent phenomenon.

---

## 3 · Emergent Webbing
The “cosmic web” forms where τ curvature is maximal, producing filamentary memory chains.  
These structures are the **first long-range networks of coherence**—precursors to biological interconnectivity.

| Domain | τ Scale | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Quantum | 10⁻¹² s | particle delay coupling |
| Galactic | 10⁷–10⁹ s | structural τ-webs |
| Planetary | 10⁴–10⁷ s | stable feedback delay systems |

---

## 4 · Interpretation
The universe doesn’t scatter energy randomly—it **threads delay** through recursive curvature.  
What appears as “gravity” is **light’s continuity** insisting on coherence across scales.

> Gravity is the language of delay; webbing is how light learns to stay connected.
