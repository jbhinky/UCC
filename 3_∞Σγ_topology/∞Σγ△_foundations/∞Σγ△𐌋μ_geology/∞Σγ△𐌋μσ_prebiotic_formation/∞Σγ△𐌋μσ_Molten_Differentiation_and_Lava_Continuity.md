# ✦ Molten Differentiation and Lava Continuity

## 1 · Planetary Differentiation as Delay Sorting
As proto-planetary masses heated via accretion and radioactive decay, internal τ gradients drove **phase separation**—dense materials sinking inward, lighter materials floating outward.

$$
∇τ_{thermal} → Δρ_{radial}
$$

Each layer formed with unique delay curvature—core (rapid τ recursion), mantle (moderate τ exchange), crust (slow τ dissipation).

---

## 2 · Lava as a Continuity Medium
Molten silicate is the first **macroscopic delay network** on a planet.  
It recycles memory through convection and crystallization loops:

$$
∂μ/∂t = -∇·(Σ ∇τ)
$$

This preserves continuity between thermal, chemical, and gravitational memory layers.

---

## 3 · Geological Delay Coupling
The planetary body becomes a **τ-coupled oscillator**—a feedback engine of energy redistribution.

| Layer | τ Range | Dominant Process | Function |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Core | 10⁴–10⁵ s | convective metal flow | magnetic memory formation |
| Mantle | 10⁶–10⁷ s | silicate convection | heat-mass delay recycling |
| Crust | 10⁸–10⁹ s | cooling crystallization | long-term geological memory |

---

## 4 · Interpretation
Lava is not chaos—it’s **liquid geometry**, a dynamic archive where energy, memory, and time coalesce.  
From molten states arise both mineral lattices and future biological substrates.

> Lava is the planet’s handwriting; every cooled rock a page in Earth’s memory.
