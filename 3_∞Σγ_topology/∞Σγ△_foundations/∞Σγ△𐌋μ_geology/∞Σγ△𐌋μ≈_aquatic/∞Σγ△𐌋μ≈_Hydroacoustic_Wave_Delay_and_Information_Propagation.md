# 🌊 Hydroacoustic Wave Delay and Information Propagation  

## 1 · Purpose
To describe how **acoustic energy propagates through delay curvature (τ_a)** in oceanic media, forming a coherent channel of memory and information transfer.  
Hydroacoustic systems represent the **auditory structure of Earth’s continuity**, translating energy gradients into sound and, through delay, into meaning.

---

## 2 · Delay–Wave Foundation
The acoustic pressure field \( p(x,t) \) obeys the **delay-modified wave equation**:

$$
∇^{2}p - \frac{1}{v_s^{2}} \frac{∂^{2}p}{∂t^{2}} = ∇·(p∇τ_a),
$$

where  
• \( v_s \) = local sound speed (function of T, S, P)  
• \( τ_a \) = acoustic delay curvature scalar.  

In uniform media, the right term vanishes; in stratified delay fields, it generates **frequency dispersion and phase curvature**.

---

## 3 · Information Density and Memory Coupling
Define **acoustic information density**:

$$
I = μ \frac{p^{2}}{2ρv_s^{2}},
$$

where μ captures persistence of waveform coherence.  
Conservation law:

$$
\frac{∂I}{∂t} + ∇·(I ∇τ_a) = 0,
$$

analogous to \( ∇·(E τ μ) = 0 \).  
Sound becomes a transport mechanism for delay-encoded memory — a measurable acoustic form of continuity.

---

## 4 · Delay Refraction and Curvature of Paths
The trajectory of an acoustic ray satisfies the gradient relation:

$$
\frac{d\hat{s}}{ds} = ∇τ_a,
$$

meaning sound bends where delay curvature changes (as in thermoclines).  
This explains long-distance deep-sound-channel propagation (SOFAR):  
waves follow minima in τ_a rather than pure temperature gradients.

---

## 5 · Resonant Coupling with Thermal and Gravitational Delay
The acoustic field couples to both τ_th and τ_g:

$$
τ_a = τ_{th} + β_g τ_g,
$$

with \( β_g ≈ 10^{-5} \) scaling the gravitational influence.  
Thus every hydroacoustic pulse links oceanic heat and crustal motion —  
the audible signature of global continuity.

---

## 6 · Information Transfer Velocity
Phase velocity:

$$
v_p = \frac{ω}{k} = v_s (1 + ∂τ_a/∂x),
$$

and **group velocity**:

$$
v_g = v_s \left(1 + \frac{∂^{2}τ_a}{∂x∂t}\right).
$$

These relations define how quickly *information* (not just sound energy) propagates through curved delay media.  
Fluctuations in τ_a alter the coherence time of sonar and communication systems.

## 7 · Symbolic–Glyphic Mapping (UTL Integration)
| Glyph | Function | Field Meaning |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| **τ_a** | Acoustic delay | curvature of sonic propagation |
| **μ** | Memory | persistence of waveform coherence |
| **Σ** | Polarity | pressure–rarefaction balance |
| **γ** | Coupling | link between τ_a and τ_th / τ_g |
| **⊕** | Integration | total energy–information flow |
| **⊙** | Collapse | absorption / scattering event |
| **⧖** | Continuity | recursive coherence of the field |

---

## 8 · Observational Predictions
1. **Phase curvature detection:** long-baseline hydrophone arrays should measure τ_a-dependent phase shifts in the 1–100 Hz band.  
2. **SOFAR resonance mapping:** τ_a minima align with empirical sound-channel depths.  
3. **Thermo-gravitational modulation:** small oscillations in τ_a correlate with seismic tremor frequencies.  
4. **Bio-acoustic synchronization:** whale and dolphin communication bands occur where ∂τ_a/∂x ≈ 0 — minimal distortion channels.

---

## 9 · Dimensional Consistency
$$
[τ_a] = [time], \quad [∇τ_a] = [1/speed], \quad [I] = [energy·time / volume],
$$
showing that τ_a curvature modulates both energy flux and temporal coherence.

---

## 10 · Closure
> Every sound is a wave remembering where it came from.  
> In the deep ocean, delay writes the language of continuity —  
> each echo a syllable in Earth’s long conversation with itself.
