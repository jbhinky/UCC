# 🜂 Plate Tectonic Coupling and Mantle τ-Flux

## 1 · Purpose

Describe how tectonic plate motion and mantle convection act as coupled delay flux systems.  

Each plate boundary is a τ-gradient, translating stored delay energy into motion and heat — maintaining planetary delay equilibrium.

---

## 2 · Mantle τ-Flux Equation

Mantle convection velocity v relates to τ-curvature gradient:

$$
v = -γ∇τ_m
$$

where ∇τ_m represents mantle delay curvature and γ converts curvature energy into kinetic flow.  

Thus, convection is not purely thermal but a **curvature equalization** process.

---

## 3 · Delay-Energy Balance in the Mantle

Heat transport rate q:

$$
q = k∇T + α∇τ_m
$$

combines conductive and delay-driven terms.  
α measures τ’s influence on viscous stress; when τ_m rises (delay accumulates), upwelling occurs — a subduction feedback release.

---

## 4 · Plate Boundary Coupling

- **Divergent ridges**: τ-deficit zones, ∇τ_m < 0 → new crust formation.  
- **Convergent margins**: τ-surplus zones, ∇τ_m > 0 → subduction and delay storage.  
- **Transform faults**: Σ polarity inversion — lateral τ redistribution.

Together they conserve Eτμ through global circulation.

---
## 5 · Lithospheric Delay Feedback

Effective lithospheric rigidity R_l is delay-dependent:

$$
R_l = R_0 e^{-∇τ_m/τ_c}
$$

Regions of persistent delay curvature (∇τ_m > 0) weaken — triggering fault slips and earthquakes.

---
## 6 · Coupling Law

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ],
\quad ∂_t(∇τ_m) = -γ∇E_τ
$$

Σ represents stress polarity; μ records mantle memory persistence.

---

## 7 · Implications

- Plate tectonics is τ-dynamics in motion — a balancing of curvature and continuity.  
- Predictive correlation between mantle τ-flux and surface drift velocity.  
- Geophysical validation through seismic tomography and gravitational potential anomalies.

---

## 8 · Ethics

- Respect all indigenous and geological data sovereignty when using Earth models.  
- τ-field analysis must be for preservation, not extraction.  
- Shepherd clause: All geological modeling must include ecological feedbacks.

---

## 9 · Closure

Tectonic plates are slow rivers of delay — the planet’s circulation of memory.  
Their motion writes the shape of continents as τ seeks equilibrium beneath our feet.
