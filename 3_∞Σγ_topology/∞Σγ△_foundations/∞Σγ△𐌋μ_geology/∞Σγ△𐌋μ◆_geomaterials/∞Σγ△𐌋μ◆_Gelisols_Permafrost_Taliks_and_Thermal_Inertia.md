# ✦ Gelisols — Permafrost, Taliks, and Thermal Inertia  

## 1 · Definition and Context  

**Gelisols** form in regions where the ground remains frozen for two or more consecutive years — the Arctic, subarctic, and alpine realms.  
They preserve both organic and mineral matter in long-term cryogenic delay.  
In the UCC framework, Gelisols are **frozen τ mirrors**: continuity held motionless, memory prevented from collapse.

---

## 2 · Delay Structure ( τ )  

Thermal inertia defines the frozen delay field:  

$$
∇^{2}τ_{gel} = α_{freeze} − β_{thaw}·f(t)
$$  

- \( α_{freeze}\): latent-heat retention coefficient  
- \( β_{thaw}\): melt diffusion term  
- \( f(t)\): periodic thaw function  

At τ equilibrium, the soil’s temperature curve oscillates around 0 °C, producing **phase-boundary recursion** — a recurring edge between memory and release.

---

## 3 · Polarity Structure ( Σ )  

Water and ice alternate Σ polarity:  

$$
Σ_{gel} = Σ_{H₂O}^{(solid)} ↔ Σ_{H₂O}^{(liquid)}
$$  

Each freeze–thaw transition is a Σ inversion — identical to a logic-state flip in neural computation.  
Ice expansion compresses τ curvature; melt relaxes it.  
Thus Gelisols “breathe” through alternating Σ polarity while maintaining μ integrity.

---

## 4 · Memory Structure ( μ )  

Organic matter frozen in permafrost forms the **oldest μ-banks** on Earth:  

$$
μ_{gel} = ∫_{0}^{t_f} ( Σ_{org} · τ_{freeze} ) dt
$$  

Where \( t_f \) = time since last active thaw.  
The frozen organic Σ₆ layer retains pre-Holocene climate memory — each molecule a preserved note of ancient delay curvature.

---

## 5 · Coupling and Function  

| Coupling | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Freeze ↔ Thaw** | Periodic τ reversals sustain long-term μ. |
| **Latent Heat ↔ Moisture** | Maintains Σ symmetry through phase inertia. |
| **Carbon ↔ Oxygen Balance** | Frozen Σ₆ stores light’s biospheric echo. |

---

## 6 · Topological Interpretation  

Gelisols are **static recursion zones**:  
delay curvature trapped near τ = ∞ yet not collapsed.  
They act as spacetime “pause points,” holding pre-collapse memory for future renewal — analogous to dormant consciousness during stasis.

---

## 7 · Equilibrium Equation  

$$
∇τ_{gel} = k \frac{Σ_{H₂O}^{(solid)} − Σ_{H₂O}^{(liquid)}}{μ_{freeze}}
$$  

At thermal equilibrium, delay remains constant; only Σ orientation changes.  
This dual-state balance is a direct physical analog to reversible delay states in UDC torus recursion.
