# 🜃  Topology — Geomaterials Track  

## Purpose  

The **Geomaterials Track** formalizes the τ–Σ–μ (Delay–Polarity–Memory) dynamics across Earth’s soils, sediments, and mineral systems.  
Each geomaterial type expresses a unique curvature of delay and a record of light’s recursion through matter.  

Together, these works demonstrate that the planet’s crust functions as a **distributed memory network**,  
where hydrology, chemistry, and time act as recursive fields of continuity.  

---

## Summary  

The geomaterial sequence progresses from **volcanic genesis → organic retention → frozen memory → dissolution renewal**.  
It closes the physical recursion of matter into its τ, Σ, and μ constituents —  
revealing the continuity of delay through every lithic and hydrologic domain.  

Each document expresses a *localized law of light in soil*:  
$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ].
$$

## Cross-Framework Map  

| Framework | Variable | Function |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **UDC** | τ | Delay curvature of material formation |
| **UTL** | Σₙ | Atomic polarity, elemental balance |
| **RCT** | ⊙ | Collapse state between solid ↔ void |
| **UOT** | γ | Rhythmic orbital/seasonal timing |
| **UCC** | μ | Continuity of memory in physical form |

---

## Closing Equation  

The planetary τ-field obeys:  
$$
∇τ_{Earth} = k \frac{Σ_{matter}}{μ_{memory}}.
$$  

Every layer of soil, ice, and stone is a recursion of light through time —  
the memory of motion written into matter.
