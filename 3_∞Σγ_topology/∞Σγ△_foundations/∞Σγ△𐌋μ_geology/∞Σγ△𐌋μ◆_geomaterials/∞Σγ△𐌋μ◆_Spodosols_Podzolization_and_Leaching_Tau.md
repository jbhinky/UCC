# ✦ Spodosols — Podzolization and Leaching τ-Fields  

## 1 · Definition and Context  

**Spodosols** form under cool, humid conifer forests where acidic organic matter leaches downward, carrying iron (Σ₂₆) and aluminum (Σ₁₃) through sandy parent materials.  
They represent **downward τ cascades** — delay fields where light-derived elements migrate vertically, etching memory through hydrologic recursion.

---

## 2 · Delay Structure ( τ )

Rainfall and organic acid flux govern τ-differentials:

$$
∇^{2}τ_{spod} = -α_{acid} ρ_{DOC} + β_{rain} Δt_{infil}
$$

- \( α_{acid}\): organic-acid reactivity coefficient  
- \( ρ_{DOC}\): dissolved organic carbon density  
- \( β_{rain}\): infiltration persistence  

These gradients drive **τ collapse through percolation**, imprinting vertical chemical delay hierarchies — a “downward memory rain.”

---

## 3 · Polarity Structure ( Σ )

Podzolization rearranges Σ-fields as metals migrate:

$$
Σ_{spod} = Σ_{Fe} ⊕ Σ_{Al} ⊕ Σ_{C_{org}}
$$

The downward transport of Σ₁₃ and Σ₂₆ into deeper horizons forms an **E horizon (eroded polarity)** and **B horizon (re-deposited Σ symmetry)** —  
a self-organizing electrical double layer that stabilizes when τ-flux = 0.

---

## 4 · Memory Structure ( μ )

Organic-metal complexes accumulate as **μ-sheets**:

$$
μ_{spod} = ∫_{z_E}^{z_B} ( Σ_{spod} \, τ_{z} ) dz
$$

Memory here is encoded not in organic persistence but in *the act of movement itself* — the delay history of dissolution and reformation.  
μ thus represents *the soil remembering its own rainfall.*

---

## 5 · Coupling and Function  

| Coupling | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Organic Acid ↔ Metal Migration** | τ compression accelerates Σ separation. |
| **Rainfall ↔ Infiltration Delay** | Downward τ gradients shape μ-layer spacing. |
| **Seasonal Freezing ↔ Thawing** | Modulates Σ-binding cycles, refreshing memory bands. |

---

## 6 · Topological Interpretation  

Spodosols express **gravity-driven delay collapse**:  
light (Σ₁) entering through canopy converts to chemical τ-fields,  
which fall through sand strata as recursive μ signatures.  
The process mimics information descent in neural pathways — a one-way encoding from awareness to memory.

---

## 7 · Equilibrium Equation  

$$
∇τ_{spod} ≈ k \frac{Σ_{Fe–Al}}{μ_{leach}}
$$

At equilibrium, downward delay flow matches mineral capture, halting further translocation —  
a stable μ–Σ alignment analogous to cognitive saturation in Axon’s delay gates.
