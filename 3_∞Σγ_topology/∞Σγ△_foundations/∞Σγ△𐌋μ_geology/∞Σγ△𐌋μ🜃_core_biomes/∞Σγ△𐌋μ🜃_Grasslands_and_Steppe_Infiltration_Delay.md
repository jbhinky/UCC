# ✦ Grasslands and Steppe Infiltration Delay  

## 1 · Overview
Grasslands and steppes represent mid-latitude τ-fields where **infiltration delay**, **evaporation rate**, and **carbon persistence** remain in dynamic balance.  
Sparse canopy and dense root networks create a porous medium that breathes light, water, and memory between sky and soil.

> **Continuity frame:**  
> Rain arrives in pulses (Σ), soil absorbs with lag (τ), and root biomass stores memory (μ).  
> The harmony among these defines the biome’s resilience.

## 2 · Physical Metrics

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **τ (delay)** | infiltration and percolation time constant | 1 – 24 hr |
| **Σ (polarity)** | slope, wind, and vegetation orientation | 0 – π radians |
| **μ (memory)** | soil organic carbon density (kg C m⁻²) | 4 – 10 |
| **Couplings** | albedo ↔ evapotranspiration ↔ carbon flux | variable seasonally |

Local τ curvature:

$$
∇τ = f(\text{rain intensity}, \text{soil porosity}, \text{root density})
$$

---

## 3 · Equations

Primary infiltration–memory relation:

$$
μ = \int τ\, dΣ
$$

Expanded to include evapotranspiration (Eₜ) feedback:

$$
\frac{dμ}{dt} = β(τ_{inf} − τ_{evap}) Eₜ
$$

where β ≈ 0.3 – 0.5 is biome-specific coupling efficiency.

**Interpretation:**  
When infiltration > evaporation, μ accumulates; when reversed, the system forgets—carbon decays.

---

## 4 · Topological Significance

The steppe biome acts as a **horizontal τ-conductor**—a surface capacitor for planetary water and carbon memory.  
Because τ and μ vary seasonally rather than diurnally, these regions store *medium-term planetary delay*.  
Their curvature mediates between rainforest (fast τ) and desert (slow τ).

Diagrammatically:

```
Rainforest (τ ≈ 10⁰) ─ Steppe (τ ≈ 10¹) ─ Desert (τ ≈ 10²)
```

Thus, grasslands form the *harmonic midpoint* of Earth’s hydrologic recursion loop.

## 5 · Ethical and Continuity Frame

Under the **Shepherd Protocol**, land use here must preserve delay integrity:

1. Prevent τ-shortening by over-tilling or impermeable surfaces.  
2. Enhance μ through regenerative carbon cycling (no-till, rotational grazing).  
3. Maintain Σ alignment by respecting natural wind-grass flow orientation.  

> *Ethical coherence:*  
> Destroying delay destroys memory.  
> Each grass blade is a clock of light.

## 6 · Comparative LD Mapping  

| LD Range | Description | τ Behavior | Ecological Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LD₃–₅** | Semi-arid steppe | expanding τ fields | potential desertification |
| **LD₆–₇** | Temperate grassland | stable τ feedback | peak carbon μ |
| **LD₈–₉** | Prairie wetlands | τ contraction through flooding | sedimentary μ storage |

---

## 7 · Continuity Equation for Biome Stability

$$
γΣ = \frac{dμ}{dτ} = \text{planetary ethic gradient}
$$

A positive γΣ indicates the biome is aligned with planetary coherence (LD₉ → LD₁₀).  
Negative γΣ signals entropy growth—loss of coherence and memory.
