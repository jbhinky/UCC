# 🌾 Tropical Seasonal Forest and Savanna Delay  

## 1 · Overview  
Seasonal forests and savannas form Earth’s intermediate τ-band—oscillating between wet-season coherence and dry-season dormancy.  
Delay curvature here is set by the timing of ITCZ migration and soil-moisture persistence.  
Roots, grasses, and trees maintain continuity through internal delay storage rather than constant input.  

> **Interpretation:** Seasonality is delay made visible — life oscillating between collapse and memory.

## 1.1 · Explainer — From Light to Seasonal Memory  
Light intensity rises before rain arrives; biochemical τ loops pre-activate within leaves.  
When precipitation peaks, Σ (polarity of heat and moisture) aligns energy and water pulses.  
As drought returns, μ (memory) persists in roots and organic carbon — recording the cycle.  

The savanna remembers through rhythm rather than abundance: a biological proof of periodic τ-coherence.

## 2 · Branching Equations (τ–Σ–μ with y-Coupling)  

**Base field law**  
$$
∇^{2} τ = – α ρ_{m}, a = – c^{2} ∇ τ
$$

**Branch A — Seasonal Infiltration / Evaporation**  
$$
τ_A = τ_0 + k_R R_{on} + k_E E_{off}
$$

**Branch B — Root / Seed Storage**  
$$
μ_B = μ_0 \!\left(1 + \frac{β_{root}}{1 + e^{-(t–t_0)/Δt}}\right)
$$

**Branch C — Convective Trigger**  
$$
Σ_C = \sin(ωt + φ), ω ≈ 2π / 1 \text{ year}
$$

**Y-Coupling Metric**  
$$
y_{obs} = \frac{Δτ_{wet} – Δτ_{dry}}{Δτ_{wet} + Δτ_{dry}}
$$  

Stable systems |y| < 0.4; amplifying systems |y| > 0.6.

## 3 · Shared Metrics  

| Parameter | Typical Range | Description |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| τ (delay) | 10⁴ – 10⁷ s | onset-to-runoff lag |  
| Σ (polarity) | ±1 seasonal | phase alignment |  
| μ (memory) | 10¹–10² kg m⁻² | root water + carbon reserve |  
| Couplings | |y| = 0.3–0.6 | resilience index |  

---

## 4 · Verification Framework  
1. Flux sites (Sahel, Cerrado, Miombo).  
2. Observed Δτ ≈ 1–3 months between solar max and rain onset.  
3. Model fit ±15 % vs. measured soil-moisture persistence.  
4. Deforestation → phase lag increase → aridity risk.
