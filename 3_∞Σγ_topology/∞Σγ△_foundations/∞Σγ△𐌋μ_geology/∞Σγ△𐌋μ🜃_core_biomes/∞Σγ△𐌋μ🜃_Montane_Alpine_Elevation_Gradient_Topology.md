# ✦ Montane Alpine Elevation Gradient Topology  

## 1 · Overview
Montane and alpine systems form **vertical τ-gradients** where light, pressure, and water interact through altitude.  
Elevation governs both delay curvature and memory density—high peaks radiate, valleys retain.

> *The mountain is delay made visible—light slowed by gravity, memory shaped by height.*

## 2 · Physical Metrics

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **τ (delay)** | lapse-rate driven time curvature | -6.5 K/km |
| **Σ (polarity)** | slope and aspect relative to solar azimuth | 0–180° |
| **μ (memory)** | biomass + soil carbon density | 3–12 kg C m⁻² |
| **Couplings** | radiation ↔ temperature ↔ snowmelt feedback | altitude-dependent |

---

## 3 · Delay Curvature Equation

Vertical τ curvature with elevation (z):

$$
∇τ = -γ (\frac{dT}{dz}) + η (\frac{dW}{dz})
$$

where γ controls lapse-rate scaling and η represents water vapor contribution.

At equilibrium:

$$
∂τ/∂t = 0 ⇒ γΣ = μ_{stable}
$$

The stability of alpine biomes thus encodes τ into spatial geometry.

## 4 · Ecosystem Coupling

Snowpack, alpine flora, and slope aspect collectively regulate τ stability:  
- **North-facing slopes** preserve τ through shading (Σ < 90°).  
- **South-facing slopes** accelerate τ collapse through radiation gain.  
- Vegetation acts as τ-buffer: conifers, mosses, and alpine meadows equalize delay curvature between day and night cycles.

**Equation:**

$$
\frac{dμ}{dz} = β (τ_{valley} - τ_{peak})
$$

This describes carbon persistence decreasing with height as delay contracts.

## 5 · LD Mapping

| LD Range | Description | τ Behavior | Ecological Function |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LD₃–₄** | Low slope forests | steady τ balance | photosynthetic μ increase |
| **LD₅–₆** | Montane mid-zone | moderate τ variation | equilibrium ecosystem |
| **LD₇–₉** | Alpine crest | τ contraction | snow/ice μ storage |
| **LD₁₀** | Glacial peaks | τ collapse | reflective Σ dominance |

---

## 6 · Ethics and Preservation

1. Prevent τ inversion from deforestation and overgrazing.  
2. Retain Σ-orientation through natural slope vegetation.  
3. Maintain snow and ice reservoirs as planetary τ buffers.

> *Every mountain holds time; to climb it is to traverse delay.*
