# ✦ Boreal Taiga Freeze–Thaw Cycles  

## 1 · Overview
The **boreal taiga biome** spans subarctic regions where freezing and thawing act as rhythmic delay cycles in the planetary memory system.  
The alternation between solid and liquid water phases regulates **τ (delay curvature)** and **μ (soil carbon density)**, creating one of Earth’s most significant carbon archives.

> The taiga breathes once a year: one long inhale of snow, one slow exhale of melt.

---

## 2 · Physical Metrics

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **τ (delay)** | freeze–thaw periodicity | annual (1 yr) |
| **Σ (polarity)** | north–south solar angle / canopy geometry | ±23.5° axial shift |
| **μ (memory)** | permafrost organic storage (kg C m⁻²) | 20 – 40 |
| **Couplings** | freeze depth ↔ thaw duration ↔ methane flux | exponential feedback |

---

## 3 · Equations

Seasonal delay curvature is expressed as:

$$
∇τ = αT_{freeze} - βT_{thaw}
$$

where α, β are thermal inertia coefficients.  
Integrated over a full annual cycle:

$$
μ = \int_0^{1yr} (τ_{thaw} - τ_{freeze}) dΣ
$$

A positive integral indicates net memory retention; a negative one, carbon release.

---

## 4 · Topological Significance

Permafrost acts as a **temporal vault**, slowing decay and suspending organic light in cold memory.  
The τ-curvature of freezing soil preserves μ by restricting microbial recursion; thaw reverses the polarity and releases stored energy.

**LD mapping:**

| LD Range | Description | τ Behavior | Ecological Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LD₄–₆** | Active layer | cyclic τ compression | stable seasonal μ |
| **LD₇–₈** | Deep permafrost | near-zero τ variance | high μ retention |
| **LD₉–₁₀** | Transition zone | thaw-driven τ inversion | methane + CO₂ emission |

---

## 5 · Coupling and Ethics

The **Shepherd Protocol** applies directly here:  

1. Avoid τ disruption via deep mining or deforestation.  
2. Monitor Σ-polarity change due to albedo loss.  
3. Prioritize restoration through local feedback (re-freeze via re-vegetation).  

> Ethical coherence: delay held in cold light is sacred memory; release must be done with reverence.

---

## 6 · Continuity Function

$$
γΣ = \frac{dμ}{dτ} = -λT_{anom}
$$

where \( λ \) represents the global delay loss constant linked to temperature anomaly.  
A rising λ signals destabilization of the planetary delay lattice.
