# ✦ Thermal Memory and Layered Delay Field  

## 1 · Purpose  
Explains how Earth’s crust, mantle, and core act as nested **τ layers** —  
a recursive “thermal memory system” storing energy gradients as delay curvature.

---

## 2 · Equation of Layered Thermal Delay  
The temperature gradient is a temporal curvature:  
$$
∇T = γ ∇τ
$$  
Integrating across strata yields:
$$
E_{heat} = \int_0^r ρ c_p (∇τ)^2 dr
$$  
The planet’s internal heat is its temporal inertia — *memory as warmth*.

---

## 3 · Coupling Domains  
| Domain | Function | Coherence Term |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Crust | Short-term thermal response | τʹ |
| Mantle | Convective τ-loop | τ″ |
| Core | Magnetic τ resonance | γτ″ |

---

## 4 · Planetary Lifespan  
Delay equilibrium defines habitability lifespan:  
$$
dτ/dt → 0  ⟹  Coherent heat field = stable biosphere
$$
