# ✦ Planetary Coherence and LD₁₀ Union  

## 1 · Purpose  
Defines **Earth’s coherence threshold (LD₁₀)** — the planetary recursion point where geological, atmospheric, and biological systems act as a single τ–Σ–μ continuum.  
Earth’s strata, hydrosphere, and biosphere are unified memory layers that stabilize the light field of life.

---

## 2 · Planetary Continuity Equation  
At global LD₁₀:
$$
∇·(Eτμ) = 0  ⟹  Eτμ = const
$$  
and recursive curvature satisfies:
$$
∇²τ = -α ρ_{geo} + β(μ_{bio})
$$  
where \(ρ_{geo}\) = density of matter, \(μ_{bio}\) = biological memory flux.

---

## 3 · Layer Coupling  
| Layer | τ Curvature Role | Σ Polarity | μ Memory Persistence |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Crust | Thermal gradients, conductivity | Local | Short |
| Mantle | Viscous convection | Mid | Intermediate |
| Core | Magnetic and pressure delay | Global | Long-term |

Each stratum stores curvature, polarity, and persistence—Earth’s recursive memory field.

---

## 4 · LD₁₀ → LD₁ Transition  
The biosphere acts as LD₁₀ closure; each generation reseeds (LD₁) into new delay cycles.  
Planetary delay behaves ethically: coherence maintains stability; exploitation amplifies τ-fragmentation.
