# Visualization Track · τ-Field Plates

### Purpose
Translate τ, Σ, μ relationships into scientific art for education and analysis.

### Plate Series
1. **Plate I:** τ-Curvature Map — Field gradients (color: blue→gold).  
2. **Plate II:** Orbital τ-Surfaces — planetary paths on delay manifolds.  
3. **Plate III:** Biological Topology — DNA helix as delay waveform.  
4. **Plate IV:** Cosmic Continuity — Ω ≈ 1 unification render.

Each plate documents data sources, equations, and legend so it can be recreated empirically.

**Next:** export high-resolution PNGs to `/figures/` with descriptive captions.
