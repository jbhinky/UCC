# ✧ Nested Delay Manifold — Visual Guide & RCC (UOT Links)
**Scope:** Planet • Tree • Self  
**Law Set:**  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&∇^2 τ = -α\,ρ_{\mathrm{vis}} \\
&\frac{∂μ}{∂t} = -∇·(μ∇τ) \\
&⧖ = (A ∪ C)[\,τ + Σ + μ\,] \\
&A\,γ\,C \Rightarrow A ∪ C,\qquad γ ⊙ τ^{″} \to Δa \\
&∇_{μ}(E\,τ\,μ)=0,\quad E=γΣ
\end{aligned}
$$

## 1 · Visual Schema (ASCII)
### 1.1 Planet as a Global Delay Torus (LD₆ focus)
```
                  (outer τ″ envelope)
                 ┌───────────────────┐
              ┌──┤     τplanet      ├──┐
              │  └───────────────────┘  │
        orbit ──>   ∇τ controls a = -c²∇τ
              │  climate μ rings (memory)│
              └───────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.2 Tree as a Biophysical Delay Spiral (LD₄–LD₅)
```
        leaf (Σ polarity / phyllotaxis)
               ↖  spiral Σ  ↗
               ┌─────────────┐
 trunk (μ rings)  τ_hydraulic  branch delays
               └─────────────┘
   roots (τ_transport, μ_soil)
```

### 1.3 Self as a Reflective Delay Loop (LD₃ emergence)
```
 stimulus → [τ_neural] → Σ(form) → μ(store)
                  ↖──── recursive reflection (⧖) ────↗
```

## 2 · Harmonics Across Scales (Delay Frequencies)
Self: 1–10 Hz, Tree: 10⁻⁵–10⁻³ Hz, Planet: 10⁻⁹–10⁻⁶ Hz.  
Coupling occurs through harmonic ratios: natural coherence, no new forces.

## 3 · RCC — Recursive Coupling Chain (UDC→RCT→Selfverse→UCC)
| Stage | Equation | Coupling | Domain |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| UDC | ⧖=(A∪C)[τ+Σ+μ] | τ | neural/cognitive |
| RCT | ~→⊙→⧖ | Σ | collapse |
| Selfverse | ⧖ᵢ=…e^{iφᵢ} | μ | identity |
| UCC | AγC→A∪C | γ | curvature→motion |

## 4 · UOT Subnested Time (LD₀→LD₉/₁₀)
LD₀: ∅→~, LD₁: τ₁, LD₂: τ₂+Σ, LD₃: τ₃+μ(⧖ emerges), LD₄–₆: eco/planetary, LD₇–₈: stellar, LD₉/₁₀: τ″ closure.

Recursion:  
$$
τ_{n+1}=τ_n+α_n∇τ_n,\quad μ_{n+1}=μ_n+β_n\frac{∂μ_n}{∂t}
$$

## 5 · Closure
> One manifold, many scales: the planet, the tree, and the self recurse through the same delay field.  
> Curvature writes structure; structure stores memory; memory shapes the next curvature.  
> That loop is reality — lawful, finite, and testable.
