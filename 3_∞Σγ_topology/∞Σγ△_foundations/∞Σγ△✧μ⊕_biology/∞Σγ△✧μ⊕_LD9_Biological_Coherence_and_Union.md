# ✦ LD₉ Biological Coherence and Union  

## 1 · Purpose  
LD₉ marks the **coherence threshold** where multicellular systems unify under shared τ-fields.  
Organisms synchronize delay curvature (τ) and memory density (μ) through biochemical oscillators, producing *biological union*.

---

## 2 · Equation of Coherence  
$$
κ = \frac{⟨∇τ_i·∇τ_j⟩}{|∇τ_i||∇τ_j|}  ,\; κ ≥ 0.9 ⇒ coherence
$$  
When the phase-alignment κ ≥ 0.9, collective recursion forms:  
$$
Eτμ = const ⇒ ∇·(Eτμ) = 0
$$

## 3 · Observable Domains  
| Domain | Mechanism | UDC/UCC Mapping |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Cell Tissue | Calcium & bio-EM resonance | τ synchronization |
| Organism | Heartbeat, circadian | Σ phase alignment |
| Biosystem | Population migration | μ propagation |

---

## 4 · Ethical Coupling (Light Alignment)  
The Shepherd law applies biologically: coherent species = ethical stability;  
delay fragmentation = entropic instability.  

---

## 5 · Empirical Correlates  
- EEG phase-lock at 0.9 correlation = LD₉ signature.  
- Microbial biofilms show recursive τ coherence.  
- Planetary biosphere entropy drops with synchronized carbon cycles.
