# 🧲 Magnetic Polarity and Field Resonance in Planetary Systems  

## 0 · Purpose  
To describe how planetary magnetic fields arise from **delay-driven polarity gradients (Σ)** interacting with rotational τ-curvature.  
This section establishes the **continuity between orbital mechanics, spin resonance, and electromagnetic field generation**, completing the τ-field foundation for planetary physics.

---

## 1 · Delay–Polarity Foundation  

Every rotating mass with internal charge movement generates a magnetic field B proportional to its delay-curvature gradient:  

$$
B = β_{Σ}\,∇×(Σ∇τ).
$$  

Here Σ is the polarity tensor representing spin orientation; ∇τ is curvature of delay within the rotating body.  
The **curl of Σ∇τ** defines magnetic flux density as a function of temporal asymmetry.  

---

## 2 · Continuity Formulation  

Total field conservation:  

$$
∇·(E τ μ Σ)=0.
$$  

Expanding:  

$$
\frac{∂(E μ Σ)}{∂t}+∇·(E μ Σ∇τ)=0.
$$  

Magnetic polarity behaves as the **angular component of the universal continuity equation**, preserving E τ μ Σ across dynamo cycles.  

---

## 3 · Planetary Dynamo Model  

In a conductive core with differential rotation ω(r):  

$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_{core} ρ_{Fe}+β_{ω} ∇^{2}ω.
$$  

Coupled with Σ(t)=sin(ω t), field resonance amplitude becomes  

$$
B(t) ∝ γ_{Σ}\,Σ(t)\,∂_{t}τ.
$$  

When ∂_{t}τ and Σ are phase-locked, the field stabilizes; when out of phase, polarity reverses — explaining magnetic reversals as **delay-phase inversions**, not chaotic events.  

---

## 4 · Coupled Orbital–Magnetic Resonance  

Orbital τ-gradients influence magnetic alignment via  

$$
∂_{t}(Σ_{planet} − Σ_{orbit}) ≈ 0 ⟹ stable magnetosphere.
$$  

Resonance breakdown (∂ₜ ΔΣ ≠ 0) produces energy leakage observable as auroral or jet emissions.  

---

## 5 · Energy–Delay Mapping  

Magnetic energy density u_B:  

$$
u_{B} = \frac{B^{2}}{2μ_{0}} = \frac{β_{Σ}^{2}}{2μ_{0}} |∇×(Σ∇τ)|^{2}.
$$  

Thus u_B is the **delay-curvature energy density**, showing that magnetism is a manifestation of stored delay curvature in rotational symmetry.

## 6 · Glyphic Integration  

| Glyph | Meaning | Magnetic Function |  
|:--:|:--|:--|  
| τ | Delay curvature | Temporal potential source of field |  
| Σ | Polarity tensor | Spin orientation and charge handedness |  
| μ | Memory | Persistence of field alignment |  
| γ | Coupling | Converts τ″ to magnetic amplitude |  
| Φ | Flux | Visible expression of ∇×(Σ∇τ) |  
| ⊙ | Collapse | Local field focus (core poles) |  
| ⊕ | Integration | Global field closure |  
| ⧖ | Observer | Resonant coupling of field and self |  

---

## 7 · Interpretation  

- **Magnetism = Rotational Memory:** A magnetic field is the echo of a planet’s rotational delay curvature.  
- **Reversal Mechanism:** Occurs when internal τ-curvature lags Σ by π, inverting field polarity without energy loss.  
- **Life Protection Function:** Stable Σ–τ alignment shields biospheric μ from solar collapse flux (⊙).  

---

## 8 · Observational Tests  

1. **Geomagnetic drift:** Measure ∂ₜ Σ → predict τ lag from core heat flux.  
2. **Solar cycle coupling:** Correlate planetary Σ phase with solar τ″ via magnetometer arrays.  
3. **Exoplanet fields:** Predict B from τ″ and ω without requiring molten core assumption.  

---

## 9 · Symbolic Closure  

> *Polarity is the heartbeat of continuity.*  
> *Every magnet is a memory of motion, every planet a song of delay.*  
> *Light circles back through metal and time — to remember how to turn.*
