# 🜂 Rotation Curves and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) from the τ-Field

## 1 · Purpose

Demonstrate how galaxy rotation curves and the **Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)** arise naturally from the τ-field formulation, without invoking unseen dark mass.

---

## 2 · Delay-Curvature Field Law

Assume the same τ-source relation as in the lensing derivation:

$$
∇²τ = -αρ_{vis}
$$

Integrating for a spherical system with density ρ_vis(r):

$$
∂_r τ(r) = rac{αM_{vis}(r)}{4πr²}
$$

where M_vis(r) is the enclosed luminous mass.

---

## 3 · Effective Acceleration

The effective potential is

$$
Φ_{eff}(r) = Φ_{GR}(r) + βτ(r)
$$

so the total acceleration is

$$
a_{tot}(r) = rac{v²(r)}{r} = -∂_rΦ_{eff}(r)
= a_{bar}(r) + β∂_rτ(r)
$$

Substitute the τ-gradient:

$$
a_{tot}(r) = a_{bar}(r) + rac{αβ}{4π}rac{M_{vis}(r)}{r²}
$$

---

  

## 4 · RAR Form

Empirically, galaxies obey

$$
a_{tot} ≈ rac{a_{bar}}{1 - e^{-\sqrt{a_{bar}/a_0}}},
$$

where a₀ ≈ 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s².  

For UCC, this corresponds to

$$
a_0 = rac{αβc²}{4π}.
$$

Thus, the observed RAR is **predicted** as the **τ-field transition** scale between strong and weak curvature regimes.

---

## 5 · Observational Test

- Fit (α,β) jointly across rotation curve datasets (SPARC, Little THINGS).  

- Require same parameters as lensing fits.  

- Plot residuals a_tot–a_bar on log–log plane; slope 1 in high a_bar, asymptotic √a_bar in low regime.

---

## 6 · Delay-Curvature Interpretation

In the UCC framework, low-acceleration regions are high-delay curvature regions — light and matter respond to geometry shaped by **memory** rather than unseen matter.  

The flat rotation velocity

$$
v_{flat} ≈ (a_0r)^{1/2}
$$

is a signature of delay curvature equilibrium.

---

## 7 · UTL Union Mapping

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ],
\quad a_{tot} = a_{bar} + β∂_rτ
$$

Σ encodes directional coherence, μ the persistence of baryonic structure, and τ the curvature delay coupling to motion.

---
## 8 · Coupling Box

- **α** — τ-source strength (same as lensing).  

- **β** — potential-level coupling.  

- **γ** — expansion coupling (used for cosmic scaling).  

- **a₀** — emergent acceleration scale = αβc²/4π.

---
## 9 · Ethics

- **Transparency:** full data fits and priors published.  

- **Integrity:** one (α,β) across all galaxies; no per-galaxy tweaking.  

- **Shepherd Clause:** declare fit windows where τ dominates clearly.

---

## 10 · Closure

The flatness of rotation curves and the universality of the RAR are not mysteries of missing mass but fingerprints of **delay curvature** τ shaping acceleration through memory and light’s inherent delay geometry.
