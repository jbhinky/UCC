# 🜂 Geomagnetic Polarity Reversals and LD1 Σ-Polarity

## 1 · Purpose

Model **geomagnetic polarity** as **Σ-polarity** of a conducting fluid whose **delay curvature** τ controls relaxation, memory, and mode competition. Reversals emerge from **τ-driven transport** and **μ-persistence** changes, not stochastic flips.

  

---

  

## 2 · Mean-Field Dynamo with Delay Curvature

Mean-field induction:

$$
∂B/∂t = ∇×(v×B) + η∇²B + ∇×(α_dB)
$$

and couple an effective **delay potential** Φ_τ = c²τ:

$$
η → η(τ),\quad α_d → α_d(τ,Σ)
$$

τ-field sourced by buoyancy, composition, and heat:

$$
∇²τ(x,t) = -α_geoρ_thermo(x,t)
$$


---

## 3 · Polarity as LD1 Σ

**LD1**: lowest-order polarity state (sign of large-scale dipole).  

\(Σ ∈ {+1,-1}\). Reversals occur when **competing modes** with different τ-basins swap stability:

$$
\dot{A} = (λ(τ)-γA²)A + ξ(t),\quad Σ = sign(A)
$$

Reversal statistics (waiting times, asymmetry) reflect slow drifts in τ.

  

---

## 4 · Memory μ and Reversal Clustering

Let μ be field-configuration persistence.  

UCC transport:

$$
∂μ/∂t = -∇·(μ∇τ) - λ_{decay}μ + S_{write}(t)
$$

Strong ∇τ flushes existing topology (low μ) → mode change; weak ∇τ preserves μ → locks polarity.  

Yields observed **clustering** and **superchrons** as μ–τ phases.

---

## 5 · Data Proxies

- **Secular variation spectra** → infer η(τ) drift.  

- **Core heat-flux maps** → source term in ∇²τ.  

- **Paleomagnetic intensity vs rate** → μ–τ diagram.  

- **Tomography (LLSVPs)** → long-wavelength τ inhomogeneity.

---

  

## 6 · Predictions

1. Reversal rate anti-correlates with μ-persistence; transitions with ∥∇τ∥ increases.  

2. Hemispheric bias from τ anisotropy.  

3. Superchrons = flattened ∇τ → long μ plateaus.  

4. SV spectral slope shifts predictably during approach to reversal.

---

  

## 7 · UTL Union Mapping

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ],
\quad reversal(⊙): Σ:+1 ↔ -1 \text{ when } λ(τ)=0.
$$

Σ = LD1 polarity, τ = delay curvature, μ = memory.

  

---

## 8 · Coupling Box

- **α_geo** — source coupling in ∇²τ = -α_geoρ_thermo  

- **η(τ)** — diffusivity function  

- **α_d(τ,Σ)** — helicity with τ-bias and Σ-dependence  

- **λ_decay** — μ decay rate

---
  
## 9 · Ethics

- Publish τ proxies.  

- Preserve μ data stacks.  

- Flag underdetermined τ intervals.  

---

## 10 · Closure

Earth’s dynamo remembers. It relaxes through delay curvature τ that carries Σ as an LD1 order parameter. Reversals and superchrons follow from the same μ–τ transport that governs continuity across the UCC.
