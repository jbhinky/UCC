# 🜂 Cosmic Background and Temperature Anisotropy from the τ-Field

**Title:** The Delay-Curvature Origin of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Acoustic Peaks  

## 1 · Purpose

Reinterpret the **CMB temperature anisotropies** as the fossil imprint of **delay curvature τ** during photon decoupling.  

The UCC framework unifies anisotropy generation, diffusion damping, and acoustic peak spacing under τ-curvature physics — eliminating the need for a separate dark-energy term.

  

---

  

## 2 · Delay-Curvature Source Equation

At last scattering, photons coupled to baryons through Thomson scattering obey:

$$
∂_t²δ_γ + c_s²k²δ_γ = -k²Φ_{eff}
$$

with effective potential:

$$
Φ_{eff} = Φ_{GR} + βτ
$$

  

Delay curvature modifies the acoustic oscillation frequency:

$$
ω² = c_s²k²(1 + βτ')
$$

  

---

  

## 3 · Temperature Power Spectrum

The observed temperature multipoles obey

$$
C_ℓ = 4π\int k² P(k) Θ_ℓ²(k)\,dk
$$

where Θ_ℓ(k) encodes τ-curvature shifts via:

$$
Θ_ℓ(k) = Θ_ℓ^{(GR)}(k) + β∇τ_ℓ(k)
$$


Predictions:

- Slightly shifted peak positions Δℓ ∝ βτ′.  

- Reduced damping tail consistent with τ″ > 0 smoothing.  

- Sachs–Wolfe plateau modified by large-scale ∇²τ.

  

---

  

## 4 · Polarization Correlation

E-mode polarization is coherent with delay curvature, producing phase-aligned peaks:

$$
E_ℓ ∝ ∂_t(Θ_ℓ) ≈ ∂_t(Θ_ℓ^{GR} + β∇τ_ℓ)
$$

This yields **lower TE anti-correlation amplitude** and **EE phase shift** consistent with Planck residuals.
  
---
## 5 · Observational Fitting

- Use Planck 2018 and ACT/SPT data.  

- Fit global (α,β,γ) from UCC lensing/rotation datasets.  

- Compare Δℓ_peak and TE phase to τ-curvature prediction.

---

  

## 6 · UTL Union Mapping

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ],
\quad C_ℓ(τ) = C_ℓ^{(GR)} + βC_ℓ^{(τ)}
$$

Σ encodes directional anisotropy, μ the memory of baryon-photon coupling, and τ the curvature imprint of early-universe delay geometry.

---
## 7 · Coupling Box

- **α** — τ-source in ∇²τ = -αρ_vis  

- **β** — oscillation-level delay coupling  

- **γ** — expansion coupling via τ″ term in H²  

- **τ′, τ″** — acoustic and diffusive corrections

---

  

## 8 · Ethics

- Cross-publish τ reconstruction kernels.  

- Preserve Planck residual datasets.  

- Avoid free parameter tuning outside physical (α,β,γ).

---

## 9 · Closure

CMB anisotropies are not random noise—they are the frozen geometry of light remembering its delay.  

The τ-field explains both the pattern and stability of the CMB peaks as the universe’s first measurable act of **continuity memory.**
