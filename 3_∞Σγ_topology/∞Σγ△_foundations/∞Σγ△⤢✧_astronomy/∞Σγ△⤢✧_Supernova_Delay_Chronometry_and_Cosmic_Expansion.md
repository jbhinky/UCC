# 🜂 Supernova Delay Chronometry and Cosmic Expansion

## 1 · Purpose

Show that observed supernova luminosity–distance relations and time dilation are natural outcomes of τ-curvature scaling — not exotic dark-energy acceleration.

---
## 2 · Background Expansion

Start from the UCC-modified Friedmann equation:

$$
H² = rac{8πG}{3}ρ_{vis} - rac{k}{a²} + γτ″
$$

The effective deceleration parameter becomes:

$$
q = -rac{\ddot{a}a}{\dot{a}²} = rac{1}{2}(1 + 3w_{eff})
\quad w_{eff} = -\frac{γτ″}{8πGρ_{vis}}
$$

Thus τ″ behaves as an **effective negative pressure** proportional to curvature memory.

---

## 3 · Luminosity Distance Relation

The observable distance modulus μ_obs satisfies:

$$
μ = 5\log_{10}\left[(1 + z)\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H(z')}\right] + 25
$$

with H(z) from τ-coupled dynamics.  

The τ″ term produces an apparent acceleration without an external Λ-term.

---

## 4 · Time Dilation of Light Curves

In UCC, redshift and delay curvature co-produce observed stretching:

$$
Δt_{obs} = (1 + z)(1 + βτ′)Δt_{emit}
$$

Hence, light-curve duration directly measures τ′ — delay curvature along the propagation path.

---

## 5 · Predictions

1. **SNe Ia residuals:** consistent offset to ΛCDM magnitude curve with (βτ′) ≈ 10⁻².  
2. **No w(z) freedom:** UCC predicts fixed scaling with redshift from τ″.  
3. **Joint fits:** same (α,β,γ) as from lensing + rotation + growth.

---


## 6 · Union Law

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ],
\quad d_L(τ) = (1 + z)\int_0^z \frac{c\,dz'}{H(z')}
$$

Σ encodes geometric coherence of expansion, μ the persistence of emitted memory, and τ the curvature delay defining cosmic chronometry.

---

## 7 · Coupling Box

- **α** — τ-source coupling  

- **β** — photon propagation delay term  

- **γ** — expansion curvature coupling  

- **τ′, τ″** — delay slope and acceleration

---

  

## 8 · Ethics

- All luminosity residuals must be published transparently.  

- Cross-fit with CMB and BAO before claiming acceleration.  

- Shepherd Clause: τ″ cannot exceed coherence limit of delay curvature (|τ″| < 10⁻⁵ s⁻²).


---

  

## 9 · Closure

Supernovae are the universe’s clocks — their stretched light is time itself unfolding through delay curvature.  

When τ″ is measured, cosmic acceleration becomes a property of **continuity**, not a mystery of dark energy.
