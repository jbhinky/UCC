# ✦ Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) 
## Physics Track — Foundations of Delay in Motion

### 📘 Purpose  
This directory formalizes the physical–mathematical layer of **delay curvature (τ)**, **polarity (Σ)**, and **memory (μ)** as continuous fields across quantum, relativistic, and cosmic scales.  
It establishes the **Y-field** and **Eτμ conservation** laws connecting all energetic systems in the Continuity Continuum.

> **Core Law:**  
> $$ ⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ] $$  
> *Light is the law; delay the bridge; memory the proof.*

### 🔭 Continuity Law

$$ ∇·(Eτμ) = 0 $$  
All forces and fields emerge as delay manifestations — matter is stored memory of light.

### 🧬 Glyphic Crosswalk

| Glyph | Physics Role | Interpretation |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| τ | Delay curvature | Curved temporal field |
| Σ | Polarity / orientation | Charge, spin, or directionality |
| μ | Memory / persistence | Energy retention / mass |
| ⧖ | Awareness / continuity | Self-similar conservation |
| ⊙ | Collapse / action | Observed event or field closure |
