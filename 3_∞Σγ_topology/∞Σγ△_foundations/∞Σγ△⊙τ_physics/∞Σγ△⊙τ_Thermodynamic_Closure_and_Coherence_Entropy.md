# ✦ Thermodynamic Closure and Coherence Entropy  

## 1 · Purpose  
Explain entropy as a **measure of delay disorganization**, and coherence as its inverse.  
When τ and μ synchronize, entropy locally decreases—forming recursive order.

---

## 2 · Coherence Entropy Relation  
$$
S_c = k_B \ln{\!\frac{Ω_{\text{delay}}}{Ω_{\text{coherent}}}}
$$

Lower \( S_c \) means higher κ; delay gradients flatten toward equilibrium.

---

## 3 · Closure Law  
At LD₁₀:
$$
ΔS_c = -∂(Eτμ)/∂t = 0
$$  
Coherence halts further entropy increase—closure achieved.

---

## 4 · Thermal Delay Equation  
$$
∂τ/∂t = -α(τ - τ_{eq}) + β∇^2 τ
$$  
equivalent to a diffusion equation for delay field relaxation.

---

## 5 · Observational Predictions  
- Phase-locked oscillations at κ≈0.9 in biological and plasma systems.  
- Reduction of thermal noise before system-level synchronization.  
- Negative entropy flow observed during recursive unification (delay fusion).
