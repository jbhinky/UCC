# ✦ Event Loop and Causality Realignment  

## 1 · Purpose
To formalize the **event-loop structure of time** and describe how **causality realigns** after an LD₁₀ collapse within the Universal Order of Time (UOT).  
This document expands the temporal recursion model introduced in *Temporal Coherence and LD Transitions.md*, adding the corrective logic that ensures each loop preserves both directionality and ethical continuity.

---

## 2 · The Event Loop
In any closed τ-field, events are connected not by linear succession but by **recursive resonance**:  

$$ E_i \leftrightarrow E_{i+1} = f(∇τ, μ, Σ) $$  

When ∇τ → 0 (temporal stillness at LD₁₀), event separation Δt → 0, causing a **causal fold**.  
Upon reseeding (LD₁), ∇τ re-emerges symmetrically:  

$$ ∇τ_{forward} = −∇τ_{reverse} $$  

This ensures that the universe’s causal fabric re-aligns without paradox or loss of memory continuity.

---

## 3 · Realignment Equation
The **Causality Realignment Equation (CRE)** expresses this conservation:

$$ \oint_{LD₁₀}^{LD₁} (Eτμ) dτ = 0 $$  

meaning that integrated energy–delay–memory balance is preserved through the entire recursion loop.  
Temporal inversion at LD₁₀ produces a mirrored event chain, re-expanding through LD₁ as a coherent timeline.

---

## 4 · Recursive Flow Map

| Phase | Description | Causal Condition |
|:--|:--|:--|
| LD₉ → LD₁₀ | Pre-collapse acceleration | \( ∂τ/∂t > 0 \) |
| LD₁₀ (⊕) | Causal convergence point | \( ∇τ = 0 \) |
| LD₁₀ → LD₁ | Temporal reseed / mirror initiation | \( ∂τ/∂t = 0 \) |
| LD₁ → LD₉ | Expansion and alignment | \( ∂τ/∂t < 0 \) |

At LD₁₀, cause and effect overlap.  
At LD₁, the timeline bifurcates into a new outward arrow—  
the “rebirth” of ordered time.

---

## 5 · Ethical Continuity Clause
**Shepherd Law of Causal Integrity**

> No timeline may collapse without ethical memory of its origin.  
> $$ μ_{preserved} / μ_{erased} ≥ 0.9 $$  
> This constant ensures all causal realignments maintain awareness continuity (A ∪ C).

Causality’s stability is not mechanical—it is ethical.  
Only coherent intent (Σ ≥ 0.9) can produce stable reseeding in τ-space.

---

## 6 · Field Implications
- **Quantum Domain:** prevents retrocausal paradox by enforcing μ-symmetry.  
- **Biological Domain:** ensures experiential continuity across memory collapse.  
- **Cosmic Domain:** stabilizes entropy flow during LD₁₀ → LD₁ transition.  
- **Ethical Domain:** defines recursion as compassion—memory honored as time itself.

---

## 7 · Recursive Equation Summary
$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[D + S + M]  
$$
and  
$$
Eτμ = constant
$$  
together yield the invariance condition for all recursive event loops:  
**time = awareness remembering itself.**
