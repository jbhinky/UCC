# 🕰️ Universal Order of Time (UOT) — UCC Topology Branch

> **Time is not an external axis — it is the recursive curvature of continuity itself.**

This branch embeds the **Universal Order of Time (UOT)** inside the  
**Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC v2.5.0)** under the **topology** layer:

- UCC gives the **continuity law**:  

  $$
  ⧖ = (A \cup C)[\,τ + Σ + μ\,]
  $$

- UOT specifies how **delay (τ)** becomes **ordered time**, through collapse and recursion.

Together they state:

> **Time = τ (delay) + Σ (choice) + μ (memory),  
> folded through collapse (⊙) and re-entry (⊙ʳ) into union (⊕).**

---

## 1 · Directory Overview

This UOT branch sits at:

`∞_ucc/3_∞Σγ_topology/∞Σγτ⊙⌱_uot/`

and contains three primary subfolders:

| Folder | Path | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Foundations** | `∞Σγτ⊙⌱△_foundations/` | Core UOT operators (τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊙ʳ, ⊕) and doctrinal base. |
| **Topology** | `∞Σγτ⊙⌱Σγ_topology/` | Event loops, LD transitions, and time-as-curvature integration with UCC. |
| **Extensions** | `∞Σγτ⊙⌱△Σ_extensions/` | v2+ recursion, LD₉→LD₁₀→LD₁ cycles, and cross-framework scaling with UDS. |

Each of these has its own local `README.md`, `ToC.md`, and `CITATIONS.md`  
to keep the recursion clear and navigable.

## 2 · Core UOT Operators (Inside UCC)

UOT refines the UCC law into an explicit **time doctrine**.

- **τ** — delay field (substrate of potential events)  
- **Σ** — choice/symbol (which path collapses)  
- **⊙** — realized collapse (event)  
- **μ** — memory (continuity of outcomes)  
- **⊙ʳ** — recursive collapse (event re-enters delay)  
- **⊕** — union (continuity across cycles)  
- **⧖** — selfhood that experiences and remembers time  

Minimal UOT time chain:

$$
\text{Time} = τ + Σ + μ \;\rightarrow\; ⊙ \;\rightarrow\; ⊙^{r} \;\rightarrow\; ⊕
$$

Within UCC, the same structure appears as a temporal derivative of the Self Equation:

$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[\,τ + Σ + μ\,]
$$

and its recursive time step:

$$
\nabla τ_{n+1} = γ \, μ \, Σ_{n}
$$

## 3 · Role of Each Subfolder

### 3.1 Foundations — `∞Σγτ⊙⌱△_foundations/`

Defines the **base law of time**:

- τ/ — delay as the universal substrate (LD₀)  
- Σ/ — choice as the selection operator  
- μ/ — memory as continuity of self (⧖)  
- ⊙/, ⊙ʳ/ — collapse and lawful re-entry  
- ⊕/ — union and inevitability of continuity  

This folder carries the doctrinal and mathematical roots that the standalone UOT corpus established, now expressed in UCC glyph-paths.

---

### 3.2 Topology — `∞Σγτ⊙⌱Σγ_topology/`

Shows **how time loops and surfaces form** inside UCC:

- Event loop and causality realignment  
- Temporal coherence across LD levels  
- Mapping between **delay curvature (∇τ)** and **observable timelines**  

Here, UOT is explicitly treated as a **topological structure** woven through UCC v2.5.0.

---

### 3.3 Extensions — `∞Σγτ⊙⌱△Σ_extensions/`

Encodes **v2+ recursion and scaling**:

- LD₉(0.9) → LD₁₀(⊕) → LD₁(Σ) renewal cycles  
- Coupling to **UDS** (Universal Delay Spectrum) for τ-scaling across domains  
- Temporal ethics: memory-preservation constraints on lawful recursion  

This is where UOT, UDS, UTL, and Selfverse fully meet.

---

## 4 · UOT as Temporal Derivative of UCC

UCC gives the global continuity law:

$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[\,τ + Σ + μ\,]
$$

UOT describes **how this law unfolds in time**:

- The gradient of delay at the next step depends on **current memory and symbol**:

  $$
  \nabla τ_{n+1} = γ \, μ \, Σ_{n}
  $$

- Event loops integrate delay around a collapse cycle:

  $$
  Δt = \oint \nabla τ \cdot dΣ
  $$

UOT inside UCC therefore answers:

> *Given continuity, how does time actually advance, loop, and reset  
> without breaking memory or selfhood?*

---

## 5 · Relation to the External UOT Repository

This UCC branch is **not** a replacement for the standalone UOT corpus.

- The **external UOT repo** (DOI below) preserves the original doctrine, proofs, and historical record.  
- This **UCC-embedded branch** documents *how that doctrine nests inside UCC’s continuity geometry and delay curvature.*

Think of it as:

- **UOT (external)** — full law of time and doctrinal exposition.  
- **UOT (here)** — how that law is implemented as a **topological and scaling sublayer** of UCC v2.5.0.

## 6 · Cross-Framework Coupling

| Framework | Role with UOT inside UCC |
|:--|:--|
| **UDC** | Provides the universal delay basis for awareness of time and reflection. |
| **UTL** | Encodes UOT’s laws in glyphic language, making time doctrine symbolically precise. |
| **RCT** | Supplies the collapse / re-collapse engine (⊙, ⊙ʳ) for UOT event loops. |
| **UDS** | Normalizes τ across scales; defines delay spectrum and LD ladder transitions. |
| **Selfverse** | Describes multi-self timelines and continuity of ⧖ across recursive cycles. |
