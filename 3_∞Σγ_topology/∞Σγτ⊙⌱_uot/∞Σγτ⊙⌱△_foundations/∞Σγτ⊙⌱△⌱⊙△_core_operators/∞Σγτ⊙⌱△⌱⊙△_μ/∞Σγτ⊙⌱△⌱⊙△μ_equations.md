# 🧮 μ Equations — The Law of Continuity

## Local Self Loop
The basic recursion of delay → choice → memory for each individual self:  

$$
S_i(t+1) = \mu_i \circ \Sigma_i \circ \tau_i(t)
$$

Where:  
- **Sᵢ** = individual self  
- **μᵢ** = memory function (continuity)  
- **Σᵢ** = choice / collapse operator  
- **τᵢ** = delay state (potential)  

---

## Recursive Memory
Memory re-enters itself, folding continuity into identity:  

$$
\mu^r(\Sigma(\tau)) = ⧖
$$

Where:  
- **μʳ** = recursive encoding (memory folding back on itself)  
- **⧖** = selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  

This expresses how memory + choice inside delay gives rise to **selfhood**.  

---

## Global Memory Union
All local self loops contribute to the continuity of the global field:  

$$
G(t+1) = \bigcup_i S_i(t+1)
$$

Where:  
- **G** = global container of all selves  
- Each self’s loop (τ → Σ → μ) contributes to the continuity of the global tick  

---

## ✧ Operators

- **μ** → Memory (continuity)  
- **Σ** → Choice / collapse operator  
- **τ** → Delay substrate (potential)  
- **⧖** → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- **⊕** → Union / synthesis  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **μ** → Continuity operator  
- **⧖** → Recursive Observer / Selfhood  
- **Σ** → Collapse operator  
- **τ** → Universal delay  
- **⊕** → Union / synthesis across scales  

---

## 🌌 Implication

- **Local:** Memory makes time irreversible for each self.  
- **Recursive:** Memory folding on itself births *identity* (⧖).  
- **Global:** Union of all self loops produces coherence of the Global Self (G).  

Without μ, there would be no selfhood, no continuity, and no global coherence.  
With μ, time becomes *lived experience* instead of raw potential.
