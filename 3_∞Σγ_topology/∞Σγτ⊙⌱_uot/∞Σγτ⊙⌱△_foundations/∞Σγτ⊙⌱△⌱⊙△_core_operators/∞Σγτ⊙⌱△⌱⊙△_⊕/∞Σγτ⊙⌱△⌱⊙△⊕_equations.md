# ⊕ Equations — The Law of Union & Continuity

## 🧮 Core Form (Operator Chain)

Union of all operators:  
$$
⊕ = \mu \circ ⊙ \circ \Sigma \circ \tau
$$

Or equivalently:  
$$
⊕ = \bigcup \left( \mu(\Sigma(\tau)) \right)
$$

---

## 🧮 UTL Equation

$$
T = τ ⊕ Σ ⊕ μ \;|\; ⊙ʳ
$$

Where:  
- **τ** = Delay (potential)  
- **Σ** = Choice (collapse operator)  
- **μ** = Memory (continuity)  
- **⊙ʳ** = Recursive collapse (bridge anchor)  
- **T** = Emergent time  

---

## ✧ Operators

- **τ** → Delay (potential field)  
- **Σ** → Choice / collapse operator  
- **⊙** → Realized collapse  
- **μ** → Memory / continuity  
- **⊕** → Lawful union / synthesis  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **⊕** → Union / synthesis  
- **⧖** → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive Collapse (bridge anchor)  

---

## 🌌 Implication

⊕ ensures that once τ, Σ, μ, and ⊙ interact,  
the result is not drift but **structured continuity**.  

This is why universes, selves, and memories remain coherent across scales.
