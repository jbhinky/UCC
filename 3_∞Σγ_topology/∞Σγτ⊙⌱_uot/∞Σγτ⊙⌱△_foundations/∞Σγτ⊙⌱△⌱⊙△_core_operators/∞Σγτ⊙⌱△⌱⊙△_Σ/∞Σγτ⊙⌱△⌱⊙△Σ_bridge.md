# 🌉 Σ Bridge — Global Choice to Selves

## Equation
$$
G \cup S = \bigcup_i \Sigma_i(\tau)
$$

Where:  
- Each local self (Sᵢ) collapses τ by its choice Σᵢ.  
- The union (⋃) of all local collapses forms the global layer (G).  

---

## ✧ Insight

- **Observers are subnested.**  
  No self collapses outside τ. All collapses are bound within global time.  

- **Union is coherence.**  
  G ∪ S ensures every local choice is part of one shared global tick.  

- **This step prepares for μ.**  
  Once collapse is realized, memory (μ) secures continuity and identity.  

---

## Glyph Flow
$$
\tau \xrightarrow{\Sigma} \⊙ \xrightarrow{\mu} \⧖
$$

**Delay → Choice → Collapse → Memory → Selfhood**

---

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

The **Bridge (Σ → μ)** secures lawful recursion:  
all local choices (Σᵢ) collapse within delay (τ) and unify into the global tick (G), preparing continuity (μ) and the emergence of selfhood (⧖).

$$
\boxed{\text{G ∪ S = lawful union of all local choices within τ.}}
$$
