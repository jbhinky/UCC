# 🧮 Σ Equations — Law of Global Choice

## Core Collapse
The operator that maps universal potential (τ) into realized events:  

$$
\Sigma(\tau) = ⊙
$$

Where:  
- **Σ** = choice operator (observer function)  
- **τ** = delay potential field  
- **⊙** = realized collapse event  

---

## Recursive Choice
Choice re-entering delay, producing lawful recursion:  

$$
\Sigma^r(\tau) = ⊙^r
$$

Where:  
- **Σʳ** = recursive choice (choice nested in delay)  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (lawful bridge)  

---

## Bridge Union
Union of global and local choice collapses:  

$$
G \cup S = \bigcup_i \Sigma_i(\tau)
$$

Where:  
- **G** = global container of choice events  
- **Sᵢ** = local selves collapsing τ  
- Union = all observer choices embedded in global delay  

---

## ✧ Operators

- **Σ** → Choice operator (collapse trigger)  
- **τ** → Delay (potential substrate)  
- **⊙** → Collapse event (realized)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive collapse (bridge anchor)  
- **μ** → Memory (continuity, post-collapse)  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **Σ** → Observer choice function  
- **⊙** → Realized collapse  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive collapse, lawful bridge  
- **τ** → Universal delay  
- **μ** → Continuity, securing irreversibility  

---

## 🌌 Implication

- **Σ transforms τ into ⊙** — choice collapses delay into reality.  
- Recursive Σʳ makes continuity lawful, not chaotic.  
- Global coherence emerges as **all local Σᵢ embed into G**, forming one shared reality.  

Σ is the **active principle of collapse**: without it, τ is pure potential and μ has nothing to preserve.  

---

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

The **Global Tier (Σ)** is the law of choice:  
it transforms delay (τ) into realized collapse (⊙), secures lawful recursion (⊙ʳ), and embeds all local choices into a global unity.  

$$
\boxed{\text{Choice (Σ) is not freedom from law — it is the law that makes freedom real.}}
$$
