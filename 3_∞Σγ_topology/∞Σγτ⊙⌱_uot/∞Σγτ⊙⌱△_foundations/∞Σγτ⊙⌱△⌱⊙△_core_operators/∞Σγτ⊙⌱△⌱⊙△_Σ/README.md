# 🌍 Σ — Global Choice (G-Tier)

**Σ (Choice)** is the collapse operator.  
It defines the **LD3–Global Tier**, where observers collapse universal potential into realized events.  

- Σ **selects** from τ (Delay).  
- Σ transforms potential → **⊙ collapse event**.  
- Σ anchors **relativity** and shared positioning inside the universal substrate.  

---

## 📂 Structure of Σ Tier

- **[∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⊙△Σ_intro.md]**  
  ✧ Explains Σ as the observer-choice operator.  
  ✧ Frames Σ as the law of collapse and relativity.  

- **[∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⊙△Σ_equations.md]**  
  ✧ Formalizes Σ’s role in collapse.  
  ✧ Introduces ⊙ (collapse event) and Σᵣ (recursive choice).  

- **[∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⊙△Σ_bridge.md]**  
  ✧ Shows Σ’s union with selves (Sᵢ).  
  ✧ Defines **G ∪ S = ⋃ᵢ Σᵢ(τ)** — the second bridge.  

---

## 🧮 Key Equations

**Core Collapse:**  
$$
\Sigma(\tau) = \text{Collapse Event } (\⊙)
$$

**Recursive Choice:**  
$$
\Sigma^r(\tau) = \⊙^r
$$

**Bridge to Selves:**  
$$
G \cup S = \bigcup_i \Sigma_i(\tau)
$$

---

## 🔑 Doctrinal Insights

- **Choice is collapse.**  
  Every act of observation or decision is Σ: the reduction of τ’s potential into a single realized outcome.  

- **Relativity emerges inside Σ.**  
  Collapse anchors space, time, and position within τ, creating coherence among observers.  

- **Recursive collapse (⊙ᵣ).**  
  When Σ re-enters τ lawfully, it generates recursive structure — the bridge toward continuity.  

---

## ✧ Glyph Mapping

- **Σ** → Choice / Observer function  
- **⊙** → Collapse event (realized)  
- **⊙ᵣ** → Recursive collapse (lawful re-entry into τ)  
- **τ** → Delay / Potential substrate  
- **μ** → Memory / Continuity  

---

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

The **Global Tier (Σ)** defines lawful choice:  
it is the operator of collapse, the generator of relativity, and the bridge from universal potential (τ) into the lived continuity of selves (μ).  

$$
\boxed{\text{Σ transforms τ → ⊙ and sustains recursion through ⊙ʳ into μ.}}
$$
