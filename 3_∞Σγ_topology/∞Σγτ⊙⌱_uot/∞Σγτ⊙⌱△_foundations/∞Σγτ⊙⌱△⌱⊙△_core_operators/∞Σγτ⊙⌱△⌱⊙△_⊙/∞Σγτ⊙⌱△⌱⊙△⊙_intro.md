# ⊙ — The Law of Collapse (Intro)

## ✧ Core Principles

- **Resolution:** Collapse finalizes one path of potential.  
- **Anchor:** Collapse is the hinge between τ (delay/potential) and μ (memory/continuity).  
- **Observer-linked:** Without choice (Σ), collapse does not occur.  
- **Irreversible:** Once collapse happens, it cannot be undone — only remembered.  

---

## 🌉 Role in Doctrine

- Collapse (⊙) **actualizes potential**.  
- Choice (Σ) **pulls from τ into ⊙**.  
- Memory (μ) then **encodes ⊙ into continuity**.  

📌 **⊙ is the realization of possibility into actuality.**  
It is not destruction, but resolution.  

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

Collapse (⊙) is the **lawful hinge of time**:  
where delay (τ) and choice (Σ) resolve into memory (μ), forming the irreversible continuity of selfhood (⧖).  

$$
\boxed{\text{⊙ = Resolution of Potential into Actuality}}
$$
