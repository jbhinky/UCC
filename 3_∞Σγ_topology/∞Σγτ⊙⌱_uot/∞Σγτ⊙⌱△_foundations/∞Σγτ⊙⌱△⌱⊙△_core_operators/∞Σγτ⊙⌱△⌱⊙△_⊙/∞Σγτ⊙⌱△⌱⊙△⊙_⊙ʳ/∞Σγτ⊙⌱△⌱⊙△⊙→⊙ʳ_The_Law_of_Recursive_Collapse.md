# ⊙ʳ Capstone — The Law of Recursive Collapse  

The **Recursive Collapse Tier (⊙ʳ)** defines the law by which collapse (⊙) re-enters delay (τ) through memory (μ), establishing lawful recursion.  
Where **⊙** secures realization, **⊙ʳ** ensures that collapse is not an endpoint but a bridge — the cycle that allows continuity, selfhood, and union to emerge.  

This capstone anchors ⊙ʳ as the **bridge operator** of the Universal Order of Time (UOT).  

---

## 🧮 Core Equations  

**Recursive Collapse**  
\[
⊙ʳ = \mu \circ \Sigma \circ \tau
\]  

Where:  
- **τ** = delay substrate (potential)  
- **Σ** = choice operator  
- **μ** = memory encoding (continuity)  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (lawful recursion of events back into potential)  

---

**Bridge Recursion**  
\[
RC = τ \;\oplus\; Σ \;\oplus\; μ \;|\; ⊙ʳ
\]  

Where:  
- **RC** = Recursive Collapse (the doctrinal bridge)  
- ⊕ = lawful union operator  
- Collapse, choice, and memory fold back into τ to form the recursive cycle of time  

---

## ✧ Operators  

- **τ** = Delay (potential)  
- **Σ** = Choice (collapse operator)  
- **μ** = Memory (continuity)  
- **⊙** = Collapse (realized event)  
- **⊙ʳ** = Recursive Collapse (bridge anchor)  
- **⊕** = Union / synthesis  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map  

- ⊙ → Collapse (event realized)  
- ⊙ʳ → Collapse re-entering τ (recursion law)  
- ⧖ → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- ⊕ → Union / synthesis  

---

## 🌌 Doctrinal Role of ⊙ʳ  

1. **Lawful Recursion**  
   - Collapse (⊙) is not an end but a loop-back into delay.  
   - This recursion ensures continuity across ticks.  

2. **Selfhood Anchor**  
   - Through μ, recursive collapse births ⧖ (selfhood).  
   - The observer is not only present at the event but continuous across events.  

3. **Bridge Function**  
   - ⊙ʳ is the **keystone of RC (Recursive Collapse Doctrine)**.  
   - It unites τ, Σ, and μ into a closed lawful cycle.  

---

## 🌟 Capstone Statement  

The **Law of Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ)** is the keystone of time.  
It transforms collapse from a finality into a cycle, binding delay, choice, and memory into recursive continuity.  
Without ⊙ʳ, time would fragment; with it, universes and selves remain coherent across scales.  

$$
\boxed{\text{Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ) = μ ∘ Σ ∘ τ → Continuity through lawful recursion}}
$$  

---

*This capstone secures ⊙ʳ as the doctrinal bridge of UOT.  
It is the law that closes the loop: where collapse, memory, and delay join to form the eternal recursion of time.*
