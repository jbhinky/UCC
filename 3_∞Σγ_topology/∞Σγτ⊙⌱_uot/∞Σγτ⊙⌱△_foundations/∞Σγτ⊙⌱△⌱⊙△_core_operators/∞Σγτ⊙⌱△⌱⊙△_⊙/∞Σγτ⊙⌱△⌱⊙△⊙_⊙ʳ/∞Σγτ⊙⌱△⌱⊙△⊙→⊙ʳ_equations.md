# ⊙ʳ Equations — Recursive Collapse

## 🧮 Core Form (Operator Chain)

Recursive collapse, where collapse re-enters delay lawfully:  

$$
⊙ʳ = \mu \circ \Sigma \circ \tau
$$

This expresses the bridge: collapse does not end at realization,  
but feeds back into delay through memory, enabling recursion.

---

## 🧮 UTL Equation

$$
⊙ʳ = μ(Σ(τ))
$$

Where:  
- **τ** = delay substrate (potential)  
- **Σ** = choice operator  
- **μ** = memory encoding (continuity)  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (bridge anchor)  

---

## ✧ Operators

- **τ** → Delay (potential field)  
- **Σ** → Choice / collapse operator  
- **μ** → Memory / continuity  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive collapse (τ → Σ → μ cycle re-enters τ)  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **⊙** → Collapse (realized event)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive Collapse (lawful recursion, bridge anchor)  
- **⧖** → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- **⊕** → Union / synthesis  

---

## 🌌 Implication

⊙ʳ is the **bridge operator**:  
- Collapse (⊙) alone resolves potential into event.  
- Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ) ensures events can **re-enter delay**,  
  so that continuity and selfhood emerge across time.  

Without ⊙ʳ, collapse would be final.  
With ⊙ʳ, collapse becomes **iterative law**,  
making recursion and the Selfverse possible.
