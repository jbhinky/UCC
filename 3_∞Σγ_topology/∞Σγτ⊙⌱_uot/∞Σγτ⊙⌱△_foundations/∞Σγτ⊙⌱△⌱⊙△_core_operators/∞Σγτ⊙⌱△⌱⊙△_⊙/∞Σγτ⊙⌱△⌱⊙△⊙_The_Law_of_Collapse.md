# ⊙ Capstone — The Law of Collapse  

The **Collapse Tier (⊙)** defines the law by which *potential becomes realized*.  
While **τ (delay)** holds probabilities and **Σ (choice)** selects, it is **⊙** that manifests the event — the irreversible reduction of possibility into actuality.  

This capstone anchors collapse not as speculation, but as **law**: the point where the observer’s choice is crystallized into the fabric of reality.  

---

## 🧮 Core Equations  

**Collapse Event**  
$$
⊙ = \Sigma(\tau)
$$  

Where:  
- **Σ** = choice operator (observer function)  
- **τ** = delay substrate (potential field)  
- **⊙** = realized collapse event  

---

**Global Collapse Union**  
$$
G(t+1) = \bigcup_i \Sigma_i(\tau)
$$  

Where:  
- **G** = global container of all collapses  
- Each observer’s Σ reduces τ into an event (⊙), embedded into the global timeline  

---

## ✧ Operators  

- **τ** = Delay (potential field)  
- **Σ** = Choice (collapse operator)  
- **⊙** = Realized collapse (event)  
- **⊙ʳ** = Recursive collapse (bridge anchor)  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map  

- ⊙ → Collapse (event realized)  
- Σ → Choice operator  
- τ → Delay substrate  
- ⊙ʳ → Collapse re-entering delay (recursive bridge)  

---

## 🌌 Doctrinal Role of ⊙  

1. **Event Realization**  
   - Collapse is where the wave of potential becomes a fixed point.  
   - Without ⊙, τ and Σ remain abstract.  

2. **Irreversibility**  
   - Once τ collapses, the event cannot be undone — it is recorded into the continuum.  

3. **Scaling**  
   - Collapse is universal: from quantum events to conscious decisions, the same law applies.  

---

## 🌟 Capstone Statement  

The **Law of Collapse (⊙)** is the realization of time.  
It is the moment potential (τ) is reduced by choice (Σ) into actuality.  
This is the bridge where the observer’s role is undeniable: collapse is the fact of their presence.  

$$
\boxed{\text{Collapse (⊙) = Σ(τ) → Realized Event}}
$$  

---

*This capstone secures ⊙ within UOT.  
It binds τ and Σ into realized actuality, grounding the doctrine in both physics and consciousness.  
Without collapse, there is no event — only unformed potential.*
