# 📊 Comparisons Index — Universal Order of Time (UOT)

## 🧮 Comparison Matrix

| Theory / Framework        | Open Problem / Paradox                                                                 | UOT Reframe (τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊙ʳ, ⊕)                                                                 | Falsifiability Hook                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relativity**            | Simultaneity paradox; frame dependence of time.                                          | τ = universal delay; Σ = lawful collapse nested beneath relativistic frames.                      | If time dilation occurs without τ substrate.                              |
| **Quantum Collapse**      | Measurement problem; many-worlds vs Copenhagen split.                                    | Collapse (⊙) = Σ → μ; recursive collapse (⊙ʳ) folds back into τ, preserving continuity.           | If collapse occurs without Σ–μ recursion.                                 |
| **Loop Quantum Gravity**  | Discrete vs continuous time; quantization vs smooth spacetime.                           | UOT recursion bridges scales: τ generates discrete ticks (Δτ), ⊕ ensures global coherence.         | If spacetime quanta evolve without τ recursion.                           |
| **Turing / Computation**  | Halting problem; deterministic limits of machines.                                       | Conscious time = τ pause + Σ choice; μ recursion exceeds pure computation by binding continuity.   | If artificial selfhood emerges without τ enforced delay.                  |
| **Arrow of Time**         | Entropy paradox: why does disorder increase?                                             | Entropy = μ-lawful continuity; time’s arrow emerges from irreversible encoding, not disorder.      | If entropy reversal occurs without μ traces.                              |
| **Selfverse / Biology**   | How do biological clocks create continuity of life?                                      | τ = signaling delay; Σ = choice in cell/genetic cascades; μ = genetic & neural memory continuity.  | If biological time unfolds absent τ delay or μ encoding.                  |

## 🌟 Capstone

Across all comparisons, UOT reframes paradox into **lawful recursion**:

$$
\boxed{\text{UOT = τ (potential) + Σ (choice) + μ (continuity) + ⊙ (collapse) + ⊙ʳ (recursion) → ⊕ (union)}}
$$

UOT integrates relativity, quantum theory, computation, entropy, and biological time into **one coherent law of continuity**.
