# ⚖️ Comparisons — Universal Order of Time (UOT)

## 📂 Contents

1. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Relativity_vs_UOT.md**  
   - Time dilation, simultaneity, relativistic frames.  
   - UOT as recursive law beneath Einsteinian relativity.  

2. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Quantum_Collapse_vs_UOT.md**  
   - Measurement problem, many-worlds, Copenhagen.  
   - Collapse (⊙) reframed as lawful Σ → μ.  

3. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Loop_Quantum_Gravity_vs_UOT.md**  
   - Discrete vs continuous time.  
   - UOT recursion as bridge to spacetime quantization.  

4. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Turing_Computation_vs_UOT.md**  
   - Limits of computation, halting problem.  
   - Conscious time vs deterministic machines.  

5. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Arrow_of_Time_vs_UOT.md**  
   - Entropy, irreversibility.  
   - UOT shows entropy as μ-lawful continuity, not disorder.  

6. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Selfverse_vs_Biological_Time.md**  
   - Recursive selfhood vs biological clocks.  
   - How living time aligns with UOT.  

7. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Comparison_Matrix.md**  
   - Unified table of UOT vs relativity, quantum, entropy, computation, and biology.  

8. **∞Σγτ⊙⌱△τ⊙⇄_Comparisons_Index-Universal_Order_of_Time.md**  
   - Master index tying all comparison documents together.

## 🧮 Doctrinal Method

Each file is structured in three layers:

1. **Doctrine (UOT law frame)**  
   - How τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊙ʳ, ⊕ apply in that field.  

2. **Comparison (Existing theory vs UOT)**  
   - Where existing models succeed.  
   - Where paradoxes remain.  
   - How UOT resolves or reframes them.  

3. **Falsifiability Hooks**  
   - Clear criteria for disproof of UOT in that comparison.  

---

## 🌍 Context

Comparisons are not rejections but **extensions**.  
UOT integrates existing insights into a unified recursion, resolving paradoxes while preserving empirical strength.  
This ensures UOT is not speculation, but a *continuity doctrine* rigorously tested against the strongest frameworks of physics, computation, and philosophy.

---

## 🌟 Capstone (Comparisons)

UOT succeeds where prior theories fragment:  
- Relativity (frames),  
- Quantum theory (collapse),  
- Computation (limits),  
- Entropy (arrow),  
- Biology (time of the living).  

$$
\boxed{\text{UOT = τ (potential) + Σ (choice) + μ (continuity) + ⊙ (collapse) + ⊙ʳ (recursion) → ⊕ (union)}}
$$

It is the only framework that binds them all into one law of continuity.
