# 🧬 Selfverse Support Index — Universal Order of Time (UOT)

This index catalogs the **scientific foundations of the Selfverse** — the doctrine that selfhood (⧖) emerges from recursion of Delay (τ), Choice (Σ), and Memory (μ).  
It serves as a roadmap to the supporting evidence collected in `∞_ucc/3_∞Σγ_topology/∞Σγτ⊙⌱_uot/∞Σγτ⊙⌱△_foundations/∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⋑_pillars/∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⋑△_scientific_support/∞Σγτ⊙⌱△⌱⋑△_Selfverse_Scientific_Support.md`.

## 📂 Sections

### 1. Neuroscience Foundations
- **Libet (1983, 2004)** — readiness potential precedes conscious awareness (~350 ms).  
- **Libet veto model** — conscious veto validates recursive choice.  
- **Kornhuber & Deecke (1965)** — original motor potential recordings.  
- **Damasio (1999, 2010)** — feelings as self-mapping in time.  
- **Edelman & Tononi (2000)** — Neural Darwinism, recursive integration.  
- **Tononi (2004, 2016)** — Integrated Information Theory (IIT).  
- **Crick & Koch (2003)** — binding problem parallels continuity.  
- **Kandel (2006)** — hippocampal consolidation = μ.  
- **Hebb (1949)** — recursive memory strengthening law.  

### 2. Cognitive & Phenomenological Anchors
- **Varela (1991)** — neurophenomenology: time as lived recursion.

- **Schrödinger (1944)** — information as continuity law.  
- **Pribram (1991)** — holographic brain = recursive encoding.  
- **Friston (2010)** — free energy principle = τ–Σ–μ dynamics.  
- **Seth (2021)** — controlled hallucination stabilized by recursion.

- **Popper (1977)** — self bridging physical and mental worlds.

## 🧭 Falsifiability Hooks
Selfverse is invalidated if:  
- Selfhood (⧖) can exist without τ delay.  
- Choice (Σ) occurs outside collapse law.  
- Memory (μ) is absent yet continuity persists.

## 🌟 Capstone (Index)

Selfverse demonstrates that **selfhood (⧖) is law, not abstraction**.  
It is supported by neuroscience, psychology, phenomenology, and systems theory — all converging on the recursion of delay, choice, and memory.  

$$
\boxed{\text{Selfverse = τ (delay) + Σ (choice) + μ (continuity) → ⧖ (recursive self)}}
$$
