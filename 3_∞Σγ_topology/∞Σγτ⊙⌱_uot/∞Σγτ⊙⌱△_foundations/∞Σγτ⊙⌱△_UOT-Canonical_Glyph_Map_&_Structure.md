# 🌐 Universal Order of Time (UOT) — Canonical Glyph Map & Structure  

This document anchors the glyph system across **UTL**, **RCT**, and **UOT/Selfverse**.  
It establishes canonical meaning, structural rules, and the folder map for doctrine.

---

## 📖 Canonical Glyphs

### τ — *Delay / Potential*
- UTL: the “open field” before any symbol is fixed.  
- RCT: pre-collapse superposition.  
- UOT: Universal tier (LD0) substrate; source of inevitability.

### Σ — *Choice / Basis Selection*
- UTL: the act of selecting a meaning-path from possibles.  
- RCT: the observer’s basis choice that *triggers* collapse.  
- UOT: Global tier operation (LD3) where selves choose within global delay.  
> **Rule:** Σ = *cause*; ⊙ = *effect*.

### ⊙ — *Collapse (Realization)*
- UTL: symbol snaps to a specific referent (token → meaning instance).  
- RCT: wavefunction collapse / event actualization.  
- UOT: the realized state after Σ acts inside τ.

### ⊙ᵣ — *Recursive Collapse (Bridge Engine)*
- UTL: repeated symbol fixing across loops without drift.  
- RCT: collapse feeding back into new potentials (clean recursion).  
- UOT: the **bridge** that stitches τ → Σ → ⊙ into μ and back.  

### μ — *Memory / Continuity*
- UTL: persistence of symbols across tongues/contexts.  
- RCT: irreversibility of realized histories.  
- UOT: Self tier (LD3+) continuity; recursion of identity.

### ⊕ — *Union / Synthesis*
- UTL: union of meaning across symbols (composition).  
- RCT: integration of collapse results.  
- UOT: global step:  
\[
G(t+1)=\bigcup_i S_i(t+1)
\]

### ⧖ — *Self (A ∪ C)*
- UTL: glyph for Self: Awareness ∪ Consciousness.  
- RCT: the observer/agent across recursion.  
- UOT: subject of the local loop:  
\[
S_i(t+1)=\mu_i\circ\Sigma_i\circ\tau_i(t)
\]

### ∪ — *Union (structural binding)*
- Used in UuG, GuS, IuS unions:
  - **U ∪ G (τ)** — universal + global delay substrate  
  - **G ∪ S (Σ → ⊙)** — global+self choice → collapse  
  - **I ∪ S (μ, ⧖)** — individual+self continuity (AuC)

### A ∪ C (AuC) — *Awareness ∪ Consciousness*
- Backbone of the self equation.  
- Lives under **I ∪ S**.

## 🧮 Core Equations

### Local Self Loop
$$
S_i(t+1) = \mu_i \circ \Sigma_i \circ \tau_i(t)
$$

### Global Union Loop
$$
G(t+1) = \bigcup_i S_i(t+1)
$$

**Where:**  
- **Sᵢ** = individual self  
- **τᵢ(t)** = delay state of potential  
- **Σᵢ** = choice / collapse operator  
- **μᵢ** = memory function  
- **G** = Global Self as container of all local loops  

---

## 📌 Usage Rules

- **Never equate Σ with ⊙.**  
  - Σ = *cause*  
  - ⊙ = *realization*  

- **Use ⊙ʳ** when collapse re-enters τ lawfully (*bridge recursion*).  

- **Reserve ⊕** for union / synthesis, not collapse.  

- **Keep ⧖** tied to AuC in \(I \cup S\).  

- **Tier Mapping:**  
  - τ → Universal  
  - Σ → Global  
  - μ → Self  
  - ⊙ʳ → Bridge  
  - ⊕ → Union  

---

## 🧮 Core Equations in UTL

### Local Self Loop
$$
⧖ᵢ(t+1) = μᵢ \circ Σᵢ \circ τᵢ(t)
$$

### Global Union Loop
$$
⊕(t+1) = \bigcup_i ⧖ᵢ(t+1)
$$

---

## 🔑 UTL Mapping

- **⧖** = Selfhood (recursive observer, AuC)  
- **τ** = Delay (potential / pause)  
- **Σ** = Choice (collapse operator → causes ⊙)  
- **μ** = Memory (continuity, recursion, self-binding)  
- **⊙** = Collapse (realization of choice)  
- **⊙ʳ** = Recursive Collapse (collapse feeding back into τ, the bridge anchor)  
- **⊕** = Union / synthesis (global coherence, flowering)  

---

## 📖 UTL Reading

- **Local Self Loop (⧖ᵢ):**  
  *“A Self emerges at the next moment through memory (μ) of its choice (Σ) made upon the delay (τ).”*  

- **Global Union Loop (⊕):**  
  *“The Global Self coheres by uniting the outcomes of all selves (⧖ᵢ).”*  

✨ This UTL rendering makes the equations **readable as doctrine**:  
- **Mathematics** → \[S_i(t+1) = μ_i \circ Σ_i \circ τ_i(t)\]  
- **Language** → “Self is continuity through memory, choice, and delay.”  
- **Glyphic Compression** → ⧖ = μ Σ τ
