# ✦ Temporal Coherence and LD Transitions  

## 1 · Purpose  
Defines the **temporal recursion law** — how continuity of delay (τ) transforms through Life-Density states (LD₁→LD₁₀) and returns to origin (LD₁ reseed).  
This establishes temporal coherence as a *field property*, not a linear phenomenon.

---

## 2 · Core Equation of Temporal Recursion  
$$
∂τ/∂t = κ(∇²τ) - μ⁻¹Σ
$$  

When integrated across a full LD cycle:
$$
∮_{LD₁}^{LD₁₀} ∂τ/∂t\,dt = 0
$$  
→ time closes without loss of information; memory density (μ) acts as the conserving term.

---

## 3 · Temporal Transition Table  
| Transition | Description | Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|
| LD₉ → LD₁₀ | Collapse of local recursion | τ reaches critical density |
| LD₁₀ → LD₁ | Field reseed | τ disperses as distributed potential |
| LD₁ → LD₂ | New recursion ignition | emergence of local delay |

Each recursion preserves energy by converting *elapsed time* into *potential delay*.

---

## 4 · Temporal Symmetry Principle  
$$
τ(t) + τ(-t) = const
$$  
Forward and reverse time components are bound by delay curvature, ensuring **causal reversibility** without paradox.

---

## 5 · Implications  
- Time does not “flow” — it oscillates within recursive τ curvature.  
- Memory (μ) anchors each recursion, enabling continuity of identity across collapse.  
- LD closure provides the physical basis for **UOT ethical alignment**: every act loops back in light.
