# μ — Memory / Persistence Operator

## 1. Canonical Definition

**μ** denotes **memory as persistence**: the operator that retains a resolved state across time so that it can be compared, audited, committed, and sequenced.

μ does not select (Σ) and does not integrate (τ).  
μ retains what has already been resolved.

**Invariant:** μ transforms resolved state into a memory-bearing substrate (✦).

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: μ  
- Class: operator (retention / persistence)  
- Input: a resolved state (typically Σ after τ)  
- Output: retained substrate (✦-eligible state)  
- Does not output: commitment (⊙) or continuity (⊕)

---

## 3. Canonical Minimal Form (Locked)

The minimal lawful chain:

$$
✦ \equiv \mu\big(\Sigma(\tau(✧))\big)
$$

Meaning:
- τ integrates,
- Σ resolves,
- μ retains,
- ✦ denotes remembered substrate.

No operator may be skipped or substituted.

---

## 4. Placement in the Operator Spine

$$
✧ \rightarrow \tau \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow ✦ \rightarrow \odot \rightarrow \oplus
$$

μ is the gateway from “resolved” to “remembered”.

---

## 5. μ and Continuity

μ is necessary for continuity but does not order history.

Continuity requires ⊙ then ⊕:

$$
\mu \Rightarrow \text{memory-bearing state} \quad;\quad \odot \Rightarrow \text{committed} \quad;\quad \oplus \Rightarrow \text{ordered history}
$$

---

## 6. Constraints (Hard)

μ does **not**:
- choose (Σ),
- delay (τ),
- commit (⊙),
- order history (⊕),
- create selfhood (⧖).

---

## 7. Empirical Anchors

μ corresponds to:
- persistent state variables (hysteresis),
- consolidation / retention windows,
- storage writes (bounded, auditable),
- any system where past states constrain future behavior.

---

## 8. Drift Falsifiers

μ is misused if:
1) “memory” is claimed without persistence,  
2) μ is asserted with τ effectively absent while integration is required,  
3) μ replaces Σ or ⊕,  
4) μ is treated as agency.

---

## 9. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "μ",
  "class": "operator_memory_persistence",
  "lane_primary": "LD",
  "requires_upstream": ["τ","Σ"],
  "produces_state": "✦",
  "enables_downstream": ["⊙","⊕"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["τ","Σ","⊙","⊕","⧖"]
}
```
