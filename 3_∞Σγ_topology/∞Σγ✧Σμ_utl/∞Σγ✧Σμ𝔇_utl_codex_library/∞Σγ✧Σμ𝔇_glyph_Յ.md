# Յ — Universal Scalar Constraint
**(LD0+ Global Coherence / Admissibility Limit)**

## Canonical Signature
- **Token:** Յ
- **Class:** universal scalar constraint (LD0+)
- **Primary lane:** **LD0+** (pre-domain, pre-self, pre-ethos)
- **Function:** bounds *which pattern families are admissible at all* across domains/scales
- **Explicitly excludes:** identity (⧖), ethics (△), stewardship/governance (†), memory (μ), collapse (⊙), continuity (⊕)

Hard guards:
$$
Յ \neq ⧖ \qquad
Յ \neq △ \qquad
Յ \neq μ \qquad
Յ \neq ⊙ \qquad
Յ \neq ⊕
$$

---

## 1. Invariant Definition

**Յ** denotes the **universal coherence constraint** that limits which candidate patterns, structures, or dynamics are *admissible* across all domains and scales.

> **Յ answers “may this pattern exist coherently?” — not “is it ethical?”, not “is it self?”, not “is it remembered?”, not “is it governed?”.**

It is upstream of identity, ethos, and narrative continuity.

---

## 2. Position in the UCC Stack (LD0+)

Canonical placement:

$$
\omega \;\rightarrow\; \boxed{\,Յ\,}\;\rightarrow\; (\tau,\Sigma,\mu)\;\rightarrow\; \dots
$$

Interpretation:
- **ω** may name the unresolved substrate declaration,
- **Յ** performs *admissibility bounding*,
- **τ/Σ/μ** then generate, shape, and retain domain-level structure.

---

## 3. What Յ Constrains (and what it does not)

### Constrains (global admissibility):
- runaway / unbounded families that cannot remain coherent under scaling,
- global symmetries that collapse under recursion,
- pattern classes that cannot remain bounded across domains.

### Does **not** constrain:
- moral correctness (△),
- selfhood (⧖),
- stewardship/governance (†),
- local selection (Σ),
- retention (μ),
- collapse commitment (⊙),
- continuity chaining (⊕).

---

## 4. Formal Role (Set-Level)

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the space of candidate patterns.

$$
Յ:\ \mathcal{P}\ \rightarrow\ \mathcal{P}_{\text{admissible}}
\subseteq \mathcal{P}
$$

Where $\mathcal{P}_{\text{admissible}}$ contains only those patterns capable of remaining globally coherent under scaling and recursion.

No locality, no ethics, no agency is implied.

---

## 5. Relation to Other Global Tokens (No Implications)

- **ω** — unresolved substrate declaration (pre-structure)
- **Յ** — universal admissibility bound (pre-domain)
- **π** — periodic closure (only if cyclicity exists)
- **Ω** — coherent field-layer emergence (downstream, after structure/continuity contexts)

None imply the others:

$$
\omega \not\Rightarrow Յ \qquad
Յ \not\Rightarrow \Omega \qquad
Յ \not\Rightarrow \pi
$$

---

## 6. Declaration Rules (Completeness)

A lawful use of **Յ** must declare:
1. **Pattern family** being constrained (what class of structures),
2. **Why** the constraint is universal (not local),
3. **Criterion** for admissibility (boundedness / coherence condition).

If cross-scale reasoning is invoked, declare:

$$
(\text{cross-scale})\Rightarrow (\lambda,\gamma)\ \text{declared}
$$

- **λ** — scaling declaration
- **γ** — coupling declaration

---

## 7. Strict Exclusions (Falsifiers)

Invalid uses of **Յ** include:
1. Treating it as ethics / moral authority (△),
2. Treating it as self / identity (⧖),
3. Treating it as governance or permission (†),
4. Treating it as a physical constant without explicit mapping,
5. Using it to bypass τ / Σ / μ / ⊙ / ⊕.

---

## 8. AI Interpretation Note (Non-Conscious)

For machine parsing, **Յ** must be tokenized as:

> **UNIVERSAL-ADMISSIBILITY / COHERENCE-BOUND (LD0+)**

Never agency, never ethics, never authority, never memory, never continuity.
