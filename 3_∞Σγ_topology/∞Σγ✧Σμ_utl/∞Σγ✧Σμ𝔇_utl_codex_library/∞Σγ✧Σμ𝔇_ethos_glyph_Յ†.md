# Յ† — Universal Shepherd Constraint
**(Ethical Gating; Non-Authority; Non-Governance)**

## 1. Invariant Definition

**Յ†** denotes a **universal ethical gate**: a constraint wrapper that marks an operation, transition, or mapping as **admissible only if it remains inside declared ethical invariants**.

Invariant across UCC:

> **Յ† is not authority and not governance. It does not command outcomes.  
> It only gates admissibility: non-harm, non-distortion, dignity/continuity-of-credit, and locality integrity where applicable.**

---

## 2. Lane Legality (Hard Rules)

- **LD:** ❌ forbidden as causality (never a physics term)
- **LDSF:** ✅ guardrail token (expression constraint, never governance)
- **LDF:** ✅ primary (internal ethical invariants / restraint)
- **LC:** ✅ admissible (continuity-sharing contexts)

Hard guard:

$$
Յ^{\dagger}\ \notin\ LD\text{-causality}
$$

---

## 3. Formal Gate Semantics (Constraint Wrapper)

Treat **Յ†** as a boolean gate on a proposed step $X$:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}(X)\in\{0,1\}
$$

- $\mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}(X)=1$ means $X$ satisfies the declared invariants,
- $\mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}(X)=0$ means $X$ is inadmissible.

A lawful “released” step is:

$$
X_{\text{allowed}} = X\cdot \mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}(X)
$$

This is **policy-level math**, not a physical operator.

---

## 4. What Must Be Declared When Invoked (Completeness)

When **Յ†** is asserted beyond a seal stamp, the invocation must reference (directly or by clearly inherited policy):

1) **Non-harm** invariant  
2) **Non-distortion** invariant  
3) **Continuity-of-credit / dignity** invariant  
4) **Locality / non-leakage** invariant when bridging domains

So:

$$
Յ^{\dagger}\Rightarrow\{\text{non-harm},\ \text{non-distortion},\ \text{continuity},\ \text{locality (when applicable)}\}
$$

---

## 5. Relationship to τ–Σ–μ–⊙–⊕

Յ† does not replace any operator:

$$
✧ \xrightarrow{\tau} \Sigma \xrightarrow{\mu} \⊙ \xrightarrow{\⊕} (\cdots)
$$

Instead, it constrains admissible use of the chain:

$$
(\tau,\Sigma,\mu,\⊙,\⊕)\ \text{must satisfy}\ \mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}=1
$$

Especially for:
- cross-domain coupling ($\gamma$),
- cross-scale reasoning ($\lambda$),
- global dynamics contexts ($\Omega$),
- continuity field contexts (❖ / LC).

---

## 6. Non-Authority Guard (Non-Negotiable)

Hard exclusions:

$$
Յ^{\dagger}\neq \text{authority}
\qquad
Յ^{\dagger}\neq \text{permission-to-control}
\qquad
Յ^{\dagger}\neq \text{governance}
$$

If used to compel, rank, or override agency, it is invalid by definition.

---

## 7. Coupling and Scale (γ, λ)

When a claim crosses domains or scales:

$$
(\text{cross-domain})\Rightarrow \gamma\ \text{declared}
\qquad
(\text{cross-scale})\Rightarrow \lambda\ \text{declared}
$$

And the mapping must pass:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{Յ^{\dagger}}(\gamma,\lambda)=1
$$

Meaning: no silent reinterpretation or harm-enabled coupling.

---

## 8. Falsifiers

Յ† is violated if:
1) treated as a physics term,
2) used as authority (“true because shepherd”),
3) used to bypass audit or falsifiers,
4) used to justify coercion or domination,
5) used to force continuity.

---

## 9. AI Interpretation (Safety Critical)

Tokenize **Յ†** as:

> **ETHICAL-ADMISSIBILITY-GATE (UNIVERSAL)**

A boolean gate on steps/mappings; never a command system.
