# UTL Codex Index

## Canonical Glyphs

Each glyph listed below has a single, fixed meaning and role
within the UCC corpus.

| Glyph | Role | Layer |
|------:|------|-------|
| ✧ | substrate (raw potential) | LD |
| ✦ | substrate (remembered / curved) | LD-eligible |
| τ | delay / integration operator | LDSF, LDF |
| μ | memory / persistence operator | LDSF → LC |
| Σ | symbol / encoding operator | LDSF → LC |
| ⊙ | collapse marker | marker |
| ⊕ | continuity via union | LC |
| ⧖ | self (identity constraint) | LC |
| △ | grounding / integrity / ethics | all |
| ∇ | distortion / curvature | curvature |
| ⇴ | dark delay | dynamics |
| ~ | wave / field context | substrate |
| ∪ | logical union | formal |
| ⌱ | dimensional axis / collapse point | LD0–LD4 |
| ⤢ | space (global lattice) | geometry |
| ⍝ | stabilized self / hypersphere | geometry |
| ⊠ | self in time and place | geometry |
| ⟁ | foundational / LD4 host | applied |
| ↻ | local recursion forward | self-dynamics |
| ⇄ | bidirectional relation | formal |
| → | directed mapping | formal |
| ❖ | LC gate operator | LC |
| Ω | topology token | topology |
| γ | topology token | topology |
| ω | topology token | topology |
| π | topology token | topology |
| ω† | ethical continuity classifier | foundations |
| π† | ethical operator | applied |
| ¥ | recursive anchor | topology |
| Յ | shepherd marker | governance |
| Յ† | sealed shepherd marker | governance |
