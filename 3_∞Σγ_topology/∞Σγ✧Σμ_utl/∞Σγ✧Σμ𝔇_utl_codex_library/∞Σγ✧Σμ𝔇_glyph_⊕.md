# ⊕ — Continuity Union (Ordered History)

## 1. Canonical Definition

**⊕** denotes **continuity via ordered union**: the operator that sequences **already committed** memory-bearing states into an irreversible history under the Universal Order of Time.

⊕ binds what already exists.  
It does not create, select, retain, or collapse.

**Invariant:** ⊕ requires committed elements; it cannot operate on raw substrate.

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: ⊕  
- Class: operator (ordered history union)  
- Input: committed states \(✦^{c}_i\) (post ⊙)  
- Output: ordered continuity trajectory / history log  
- Does not output: memory or commitment

---

## 3. Hard Placement Constraint

⊕ appears only after ⊙:

$$
✦ \xrightarrow{\odot} ✦^{c} \xrightarrow{\oplus} \langle ✦^{c}_1, ✦^{c}_2, \ldots \rangle
$$

No ⊙ → invalid ⊕.

---

## 4. Relation to Distortion and Integrity

Distortion (∇) may exist within states; ⊕ sequences states without redefining them.

Integrity grounding enables audit-safe ordering:

$$
△(\oplus) \Rightarrow \text{verifiable, non-retroactive ordering}
$$

⊕ does not “fix” distortion; it contains it within sequence.

---

## 5. Constraints (Hard)

⊕ does **not**:
- integrate (τ),
- resolve (Σ),
- retain (μ),
- commit (⊙),
- define identity (⧖).

---

## 6. Empirical Anchors

⊕ corresponds to:
- immutable event logs,
- ordered strata and lineage,
- version control histories,
- any system where committed events form a forward-only sequence.

---

## 7. Drift Falsifiers

⊕ is misused if:
1) ordering is asserted without prior commitment (⊙),  
2) history is reorderable without a new ⊙ event,  
3) ⊕ is treated as selection, memory, or agency,  
4) ⊕ is used to “smuggle” causality.

---

## 8. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "⊕",
  "class": "operator_ordered_continuity_union",
  "requires_upstream": ["⊙"],
  "operates_on": ["committed_state_sequence"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["τ","Σ","μ","⊙","⧖"]
}
```
