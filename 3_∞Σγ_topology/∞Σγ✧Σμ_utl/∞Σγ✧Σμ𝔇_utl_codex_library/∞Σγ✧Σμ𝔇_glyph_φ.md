# φ — Phase / State Angle / Rotational Context

## 1. Definition

**φ** denotes **phase**:  
the rotational / cyclical state-angle that parameterizes a signal’s position within an oscillation, orbit, rhythm, or interference cycle.

Invariant meaning across the UCC corpus:

> **φ is the phase-coordinate of a signal or state, used to keep recursion, resonance, and interference physically grounded and time-ordered.**

φ is not a glyph for “light” or “meaning.”  
φ is a **state-angle coordinate**.

## 2. Corpus-wide stability (content + paths)

φ is an already-stabilized operator across the UCC corpus, appearing extensively in geometry, topology, signal, and dynamics files.  
This codex file formalizes φ strictly as the **phase operator**, not as language, metaphor, or ontology.

(Any occurrence of Greek φῶς is textual Greek, not the φ operator.)

## 3. Canonical role

- **Role:** coordinate (phase / rotation / cyclic state)
- **Primary lane:** **LD** (physical signal-grounding)
- **Eligibility:** LDF and LDSF as descriptive projections only
- **Function:** stabilize oscillation, resonance, and recursion without drift

φ does not create, select, or remember.  
φ **locates**.

## 4. φ in the signal chain

σ is the resonant carrier.  
φ locates σ within its cycle.

$$
σ(⤢, φ)
$$

Without φ, oscillatory claims are non-falsifiable.

## 5. Phase–delay relation (UOT-safe)

$$
Δφ = ωτ = 2πντ
$$

Constraints:
- τ orders time
- φ is evaluated forward-only
- no retrocausality permitted

## 6. φ and recursion (↻)

Forward recursion may reuse state:

$$
↻(σ(φ)) \text{ allowed}
$$

But may not rewrite prior phase:

$$
φ_{t_n} \not\rightarrow φ_{t_{n-1}}
$$

## 7. φ, selection (Σ), and collapse (⊙)

φ provides **context**, not choice:

$$
Σ(σ(φ)) → s → μ → ⊙ → ⊕
$$

## 8. φ and distortion (∇)

φ is a coordinate.  
∇ is curvature over remembered structure.

They are related but not interchangeable.

## 9. Constants and bounds

$$
φ ∈ [0, 2π)
$$

$$
φ(t) = φ_0 + ωt
$$

## 10. Dimensional and spatial locality

$$
φ \text{ must be evaluated at } (⌱, ⤢)
$$

## 11. Constraints

φ is not:
- identity (⧖)
- memory (μ)
- selection (Σ)
- collapse (⊙)
- continuity (⊕)
- distortion (∇)

## 12. Empirical anchors

- wave phase
- interference
- orbital dynamics
- oscillators
- circadian rhythms

## 13. Falsifiers

φ is invalid if:
1) asserted without oscillatory carrier
2) used to imply retrocausality
3) substituted for Σ or μ
4) allowed to drift across ⌱ without coupling

## 14. AI interpretation note

φ is a **cycle-state coordinate**, not identity, meaning, or agency.
