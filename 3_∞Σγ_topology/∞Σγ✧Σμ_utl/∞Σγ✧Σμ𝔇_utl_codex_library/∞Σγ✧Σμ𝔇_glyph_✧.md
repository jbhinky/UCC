# ✧ — Raw Substrate (Pre-Integrated Light)

## 1. Canonical Definition

**✧** denotes the **raw substrate**: unintegrated, non-persistent input prior to delay, symbolization, memory, or commitment.

✧ is not a force, identity, memory, or metaphysical primitive.  
It is a **formal substrate token** used to mark the pre-structured state of any signal, interaction, or input.

**Invariant:** ✧ exists without persistence, without history, and without continuity.

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: ✧  
- Class: Substrate token (raw / pre-integrated)  
- Primary Lane: LD  
- Interpretive Projection: LDF, LDSF (lens only; definition unchanged)  
- Persistence: none  
- History: none  

✧ is a starting condition, never an outcome.

---

## 3. Operator Preconditions

✧ has no structure by itself.  
All structure arises only through canonical operators:

- τ — delay / temporal integration  
- Σ — symbolic or structural encoding  
- μ — memory / persistence  

Canonical transitions:

✧ → τ → ∫✧(t)dt  

✧ → (τ + μ) → ✦  

✧ cannot bypass τ or μ under any circumstance.

---

## 4. Closed Execution Loop (Entry Only)

✧ appears only at loop entry.

✧ → τ → Σ → μ → ✦ → ⊙ → ⊕

✧ never reappears downstream as a persistence or continuity substitute.

---

## 5. Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

✧ cannot:
- store memory (μ required)
- assert continuity (⊕ required)
- commit state (⊙ required)
- assert identity (⧖ required)
- imply curvature (✦ required)

Any document doing so is formally invalid.

---

## 6. Empirical Grounding (Non-Metaphysical)

✧ corresponds to:
- sensory input prior to neural integration  
- photonic interaction prior to retention  
- unbuffered data streams  
- pre-symbolic perceptual input  

✧ exists to prevent premature claims.

---

## 7. Drift Falsifiers

✧ is misused if:
1. treated as persistent  
2. treated as continuous  
3. treated as causal  
4. used as a synonym for ✦  
5. bypasses τ or Σ while structure is claimed  

Any one falsifies the statement locally.

---

## 8. Completeness Rule

Any statement using ✧ is incomplete if it implies structure, memory, or history without explicit τ, Σ, and μ (and ⊙ / ⊕ where applicable).

---

## 9. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "✧",
  "class": "substrate_raw",
  "lane_primary": "LD",
  "persistent": false,
  "requires_for_structure": ["τ","Σ"],
  "requires_for_persistence": ["μ"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["μ","⊙","⊕","⧖"]
}
```

  

## 10. Corpus Role Summary

✧ exists to anchor LD correctness, prevent symbolic leakage, enforce falsifiability, and provide a shared zero-state for humans and machines.
