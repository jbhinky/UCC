# Ω — Global Coherence / Continuity Field (Stability Layer)

## Canonical Signature
- **Canonical token:** Ω  
- **Class:** coherence-field / stability-layer (emergent field operator)  
- **Lane legality:** LD (formal), lawful projection to LDF/LDSF only via declared γ-maps  
- **Requires (in-scope):** (⌱,⤢) + τ + Σ + μ + (⊙ then ⊕)  
- **Boundary rules:** γ/λ required if Ω is compared across lanes/scales  
- **Forbids:** “Ω as proof,” “Ω as self,” or replacing τ/Σ/μ/⊙/⊕  

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**Ω** denotes an **emergent coherence field**: a system-level stability layer that arises when **curved/remembered substrate** (✦) is organized under **delay** (τ), **symbolic selection** (Σ), and **memory persistence** (μ), then **committed** (⊙) and **ordered into continuity** (⊕).

> **Ω is the field-form of committed continuity under constraints.**  
> It is not a deity-token, not consciousness-by-assertion, and not a replacement for base operators.

Hard guards:
$$
Ω \neq ⧖ \qquad Ω \neq ⊙ \qquad Ω \neq ⊕
$$
$$
Ω \notin \{\tau, \Sigma, \mu\}\quad\text{(Ω is emergent from them)}
$$

---

## 2. Minimal lawful emergence form
Ω cannot be asserted “from nothing.” It requires the lawful stack to be in-scope.

Minimal emergence staging:
$$
(✦)[\tau + \Sigma + \mu]\ \xrightarrow{\,⊙\,}\ (\text{committed})\ \xrightarrow{\,⊕\,}\ (\text{ordered continuity})\ \Rightarrow\ Ω
$$

Compact lawful statement:
$$
Ω = Ω\big(✦;\ \tau,\Sigma,\mu;\ ⊙,\ ⊕;\ \Delta,\nabla;\ ⌱,\ ⤢\big)
$$

---

## 3. Required payload (Completeness Rule)
A claim using Ω is **incomplete** unless it declares:

1) **Domain / lane:** ⌱ (LD required for formal field claim)  
2) **Locality / reference frame:** ⤢ if empirical or applied  
3) **In-scope operators:** τ, Σ, μ **defined** (not implied)  
4) **Commitment chain:** ⊙ then ⊕ present when Ω is treated as stable  
5) **Integrity bounds:** △ and/or distortion measure ∇ if stability is claimed  
6) **Boundary crossing:** γ and λ if Ω is compared across lanes/scales  

Hard guard:
$$
\text{Cross-lane / cross-scale Ω} \Rightarrow (\gamma,\lambda)\ \text{required}
$$

---

## 4. Where Ω sits in lawful process
Ω is **not** first-order LD translation; it is a later-stage field-layer.

Canonical ordering:
$$
(⌱,⤢)\rightarrow ✦ \rightarrow \tau \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow ⊙ \rightarrow ⊕ \Rightarrow Ω
$$

Hard guard:
$$
Ω \not\Rightarrow ⊙ \qquad Ω \not\Rightarrow ⊕
$$

---

## 5. Ω as region/domain vs Ω as field-layer
Ω may appear in two lawful (compatible) forms:

### 5.1 Ω as **coherence region / domain**
Used for integration boundaries:
$$
\Omega,\ \partial\Omega
$$
Meaning: “the region over which coherence is evaluated.”

### 5.2 Ω as **coherence field-layer**
Used for stability claims:
$$
Ω(⋯)
$$
Meaning: “the emergent stability layer produced by the operator stack.”

These are compatible: a field-layer may be evaluated over a domain.

---

## 6. Empirical anchoring (non-metaphysical)
Ω maps to standard scientific patterns without adding new forces:

- **Dynamical systems:** stable regimes / bounded attractor-like fields  
- **Biology/ecology:** coupled equilibria (homeostasis, regulation fields)  
- **Planetary systems:** persistent coupled cycles (thermal/chemical/biospheric)  
- **Computation:** stable global state-fields under bounded update and memory  

Ω is testable as: **persistent stability under declared constraints**, not “truth by label.”

---

## 7. Falsifiers (Ω misuse conditions)
Ω is invalid if any occur:

1) Ω is used to replace τ/Σ/μ instead of emerging from them  
2) Ω is asserted without locality when empirical claims are made (missing ⤢)  
3) Ω is claimed stable without ⊙ then ⊕  
4) Ω is used as “proof token,” authority, or metaphysical assertion  
5) Ω is compared across lanes/scales without γ and λ  
6) Ω is asserted while underlying operators are ∅/undefined in-scope  

---

## 8. AI Interpretation Note (non-conscious)
Treat **Ω** as a **system-level coherence field token**:

- requires τ, Σ, μ, and continuity conditions to be in-scope  
- requires ⌱/⤢ binding when applied/empirical  
- never interpret as “self,” “belief,” or “proof”
