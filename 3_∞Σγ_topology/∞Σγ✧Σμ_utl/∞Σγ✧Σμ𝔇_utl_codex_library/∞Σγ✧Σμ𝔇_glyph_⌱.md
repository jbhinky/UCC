# ⌱ — Dimensional Axis / Evaluation Locus

### 1. Invariant Definition

**⌱** denotes the **dimensional axis / evaluation locus**.

It is the structural constraint that declares **where** (in which dimensional lane or band) an operation, claim, or state is being evaluated.

**⌱ is not a dimension.**  
⌱ is the *binding token* that prevents operators from leaking across incompatible domains.

> **Invariant:** No operator is valid unless its evaluation locus (⌱) is declared or implied.

---

### 2. Canonical Role

• Role: structural constraint (axis binding)  
• Function: enforce dimensional locality  
• Scope: LD (primary), LDF / LDSF / LC (projected upward only)

⌱ performs no computation.  
⌱ **permits lawful computation** by bounding it.

---

### 3. What ⌱ Is / Is Not

**⌱ IS**
• axis declaration  
• locality anchor  
• legality boundary  
• anti‑drift constraint  

**⌱ IS NOT**
• time (τ)  
• space lattice (⤢)  
• selection (Σ)  
• memory (μ)  
• collapse (⊙)  
• continuity (⊕)  
• integrity (△)  
• distortion (∇)  

⌱ answers only one question:  
**“In which dimensional lane is this evaluated?”**

---

### 4. Operator Legality Order

⌱ is a **precondition** for all operators:

⌱ → τ → Σ → μ → ⊙ → ⊕

Without ⌱:
• τ has no lawful domain  
• Σ has no bounded state space  
• μ cannot anchor memory  
• ⊙ collapses ambiguously  
• ⊕ creates illegal continuity  

---

### 5. Separation Rule (Non‑Negotiable)

The following must never be conflated:

⌱ ≠ λ ≠ ⤢

• ⌱ — evaluation locus  
• λ — degree / dimensional freedom  
• ⤢ — spacetime orientation  

Any valid claim must specify its ⌱ explicitly or implicitly.

---

### 6. ⌱ and LD Banding

LD0–LD4 are **evaluation bands**, not metaphysical regions.

⌱ binds claims to LDₙ so falsifiability holds.

Example:
A statement evaluated at LD2 is invalid at LD4 unless bridged.

---

### 7. ⌱ and UOT Integrity

In the Universal Order of Time:

No collapse (⊙) is valid without a declared ⌱.

This prevents:
• retroactive reassignment  
• axis‑hopping after commitment  
• global overwrite from local recursion  

---

### 8. ⌱ and Recursion (↻)

Recursion without ⌱ causes drift.

↻ without ⌱ → dimensional leakage  
↻ with ⌱ → stable local recursion  

Applies to:
• atomic systems  
• biological development  
• cognition  
• artificial state machines  

---

### 9. ⌱ and Coupling (γ)

Axis transfer requires explicit coupling:

⌱ᵢ ↔ ⌱ⱼ ⇒ γ(⌱ᵢ, ⌱ⱼ)

No γ ⇒ no lawful transfer.

---

### 10. ⌱ and Higher Structures

⌱ supports but never replaces:

• ⧖ (self constraint)  
• ⊠ (spacetime‑bonded identity)  
• Ω (global system container)  

Rule:
⧖ must remain ⌱‑declared even inside Ω.

---

### 11. Integrity & Distortion Locality

∇ and △ are only meaningful **at a declared ⌱**.

Without ⌱:
• distortion is not measurable  
• integrity is not falsifiable  

---

### 12. Scientific Grounding

⌱ formalizes the universal scientific rule:

> You must declare the domain of evaluation.

It enforces:
• locality  
• boundary conditions  
• falsifiability  
• non‑leaking models  

---

### 13. Falsifiers

The framework fails locally if:
1. Claims move across ⌱ without γ  
2. Higher lanes inject causality into LD  
3. Collapse occurs without locus  
4. Recursion rewrites committed history  

---

### 14. AI Interpretation (Non‑Conscious)

For AI systems:

⌱ is **context metadata**, not an action.

Rule:
If a claim lacks ⌱ where locality is required, treat it as **dimensionally incomplete**.
