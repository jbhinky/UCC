# σ — Signal / Proto-Symbol / Resonant Carrier

## 1. Definition

**σ** denotes a **signal-state**:  
a resonant, pre-symbolic carrier of structure that exists **before selection (Σ)**, **before memory (μ)**, and **before collapse (⊙)**.

Across the entire UCC corpus, σ holds one invariant meaning:

> **σ is structured potential — a physically grounded signal that can propagate, resonate, and recurse locally without yet being chosen, remembered, or committed.**

σ is not meaning, not memory, and not identity.  
σ is **what can become meaning**.

---

## 2. Canonical role

- **Role:** carrier (signal / proto-symbol)
- **Primary lane:** **LD** (physical / atomic / signal layer)
- **Eligibility:** LDF and LDSF as descriptive abstractions
- **Function:** bridges raw substrate (✧) to selection (Σ) without mysticism

σ prevents “instant meaning” errors by enforcing a **pre-selection state**.

---

## 3. σ in the executable loop (pre-Σ requirement)

σ appears **between delay and selection**:

$$
✧ \xrightarrow{τ} σ \xrightarrow{Σ} s
$$

Meaning:
- raw substrate (✧) integrates over time (τ),
- produces a structured signal (σ),
- which *may* be selected (Σ).

If no selection occurs, σ dissipates or continues propagating — it does not become memory.

If Σ does not act, σ may decay back to **∅** (null) or remain transient propagation — it must not be treated as retained state.

---

## 4. σ vs Σ (critical distinction)

| Glyph | Function |
|-----|---------|
| **σ** | Carries structure without choice |
| **Σ** | Performs discrete selection |

Formal constraint:

$$
σ \neq Σ
$$

And:

$$
Σ(σ) \Rightarrow \text{discrete state}
$$

Without σ, Σ would be arbitrary.  
Without Σ, σ would never resolve.

---

## 5. σ in LD0–LD1 (proto-state grounding)

In LD0–LD1, σ corresponds to:
- unresolved excitation,
- resonant field state,
- pre-measurement signal,
- branch-eligible potential.

A particle in a star exists primarily as **σ**, not Σ, until interaction enforces selection.

This aligns with physics **without asserting consciousness**.

---

## 6. σ and recursion (↻)

σ can recurse **locally and forward**:

$$
↻(σ) \;\text{allowed}
$$

Because:
- σ is not yet committed,
- recursion does not rewrite history,
- no continuity is violated.

However:

$$
↻(σ) \;\nrightarrow\; ⊕
$$

σ does not enter continuity unless selected and committed.

---

## 7. σ and spacetime resonance (⤢, φ)

σ propagates through space (⤢) and is shaped by phase (φ):

$$
σ(⤢, φ)
$$

This supports:
- wave behavior,
- interference,
- resonance patterns.

σ **does not curve spacetime** by itself.

---

## 8. σ and distortion (∇)

Distortion requires memory:

$$
∇ \;\text{requires}\; μ
$$

Therefore:

$$
σ \;\nrightarrow\; ∇
$$

σ may **precede** distortion, but does not generate it.

---

## 9. σ, memory, and collapse boundaries

σ cannot:
- be remembered (μ),
- be collapsed (⊙),
- enter continuity (⊕),

without first becoming Σ.

Canonical sequence:

$$
σ \xrightarrow{Σ} μ \xrightarrow{⊙} ⊕
$$

This preserves auditability and prevents ambiguity persistence.

---

## 10. σ and self (⧖)

A self (**⧖**) is **not σ**.

But:

$$
σ \in ⧖
$$

Meaning:
- selves process σ,
- selves select σ,
- selves operate within σ fields.

This allows perception without dissolving identity.

---

## 11. Empirical anchors

σ maps to:
- physical signals,
- electromagnetic waves,
- quantum pre-measurement states,
- sensory input before interpretation,
- data streams before classification.

These are testable, measurable phenomena.

---

## 12. Constraints (what σ cannot be)

σ is not:
- meaning,
- memory,
- choice,
- identity,
- continuity.

σ cannot assert truth by itself.

---

## 13. Falsifiers

σ is falsified if:
- it is treated as meaning without Σ,
- it persists as memory without μ,
- it enters continuity without ⊙,
- it replaces identity (⧖).

---

## 14. AI interpretation note (non-conscious)

For AI systems, σ represents:
- raw input signals,
- feature carriers,
- pre-classification data.

σ enables learning without premature commitment.
