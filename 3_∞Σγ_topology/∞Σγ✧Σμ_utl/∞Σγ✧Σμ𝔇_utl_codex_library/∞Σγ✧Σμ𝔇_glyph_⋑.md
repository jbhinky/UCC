# ⋑ — Convergence / Meet Operator (Bounded Aggregation)

## Canonical Signature
- **Token:** ⋑  
- **Class:** convergence / meet / bounded aggregation operator  
- **Lane legality:** LD primary; may be referenced in LDF/LDSF without redefining meaning  
- **Requires:** declared scope (⌱) and declared merge constraints; if cross-lane/scale, declare (γ, λ)  
- **Forbids:** silently implying ⊙ commit, ⊕ continuity union, or identity merge

Hard guards:
$$
⋑ \neq ⊙ \qquad ⋑ \neq ⊕ \qquad ⋑ \neq ⧖
$$

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**⋑** denotes **convergence**: multiple streams/paths/states are brought into a **common bounded intersection** (a “meet”) under explicit constraints.

> **⋑ means “converge under declared bounds,” not “erase differences,” not “commit,” and not “continuity union.”**

---

## 2. Required payload (Completeness Rule)
A ⋑ statement is incomplete unless it declares:

1) **Scope:** ⌱ (lane/domain)  
2) **Inputs:** the set/streams being converged  
3) **Constraint:** the rule that defines the meet (tolerance, bounds, criterion)  
4) **If applied:** locality/reference frame ⤢  
5) **If cross-scale:** λ; **if cross-lane:** γ

Guard:
$$
(\text{cross-lane or cross-scale }⋑)\Rightarrow (\gamma,\lambda)\ \text{declared}
$$

---

## 3. Formal shapes (LD)
Set-meet form:
$$
A ⋑ B := A \cap B \quad \text{(when the meet is literal intersection)}
$$

Constraint-meet form:
$$
A ⋑_{\kappa} B := \{x\in A\cup B\ :\ \kappa(x)\ \text{holds}\}
$$

---

## 4. Relationship to ⊙ and ⊕
⋑ can occur **before** commitment and continuity ordering:

$$
(\text{candidates}) \xrightarrow{⋑} (\text{converged subset}) \xrightarrow{⊙} (\text{committed}) \xrightarrow{⊕} (\text{ordered continuity})
$$

Hard guard:
$$
⋑ \not\Rightarrow ⊙ \qquad ⋑ \not\Rightarrow ⊕
$$

---

## 5. ⋑ vs ⋒
- **⋑** = convergence / meet / coming together  
- **⋒** = divergence / split / moving apart (separate file)

---

## 6. Falsifiers
⋑ is misused if:
1) used to imply commitment (⊙) without ⊙  
2) used to imply continuity ordering (⊕) without ⊕  
3) used to claim identity merge (⧖ merge) without explicit identity operators and constraints  
4) used cross-lane/scale without (γ, λ) declarations  
5) used without explicit constraints (meet criterion unspecified)

---

## 7. AI interpretation note (non-conscious)
Parse **⋑** as:
- a **bounded convergence operator**
- a **meet / intersection under declared criterion**
Never treat it as “commit,” “union,” or “identity merge.”
