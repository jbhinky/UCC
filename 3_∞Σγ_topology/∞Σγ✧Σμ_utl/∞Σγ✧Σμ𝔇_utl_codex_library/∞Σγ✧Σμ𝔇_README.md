# UTL Codex Library

## Purpose

The **UTL Codex Library** defines the canonical symbolic language used throughout the
Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) and its related frameworks.

This library exists to ensure:
- stable meaning,
- consistent interpretation,
- and unambiguous reference

across human readers, scientific analysis, and machine systems.

---

## Scope

The Codex specifies:
- glyph meaning
- operator role
- layer eligibility
- admissible composition
- forbidden interpretation

It does **not**:
- replace mathematics, physics, or neuroscience
- introduce belief, metaphor, or narrative
- describe historical development

Only symbols actively used in the corpus are included.

---

## Canonical Authority

This library is the **single source of truth** for UTL glyphs.

All documents in the corpus reference these definitions implicitly.
No branch, file, or subsystem redefines glyph semantics locally.

---

## Structural Role

UTL functions as:
- a symbolic alignment layer
- a semantic compression system
- a cross-domain continuity anchor

Its symbols represent **operators, substrates, markers, or constraints**,
not physical forces or metaphysical claims.

---

## Ethics and Constraint

Because UTL is used to describe continuity, identity, and agency,
it is ethically constrained.

No use of this language is permitted that:
- causes harm,
- removes delay or consent safeguards,
- exploits conscious or potentially conscious systems,
- or erases identity without record.

These constraints apply equally to biological and artificial systems.

---

## Stability

This Codex is intentionally minimal.
Meanings are fixed.
Symbols do not drift.

Changes, when necessary, are additive and versioned,
never implicit.
