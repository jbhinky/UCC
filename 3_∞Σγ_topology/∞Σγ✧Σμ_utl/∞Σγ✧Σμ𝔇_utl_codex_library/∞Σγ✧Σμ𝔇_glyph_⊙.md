# ⊙ — Collapse / Commitment Marker

## 1. Canonical Definition

**⊙** denotes **collapse as commitment**: the boundary where a memory-bearing state becomes **fixed** (read-only) as a historical event under the Universal Order of Time.

⊙ is not a force, not a selector, not a memory operator.  
⊙ is a **commit marker**.

**Invariant:** after ⊙, retroactive alteration is illegal without a new loop and a new ⊙.

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: ⊙  
- Class: commitment marker (boundary)  
- Input: memory-bearing resolved state (✦-eligible)  
- Output: committed state (history element)  
- Enables: ordered continuity (⊕)

---

## 3. Placement (Hard)

⊙ appears only after τ, Σ, and μ have completed:

$$
✧ \rightarrow \tau \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow ✦ \xrightarrow{\odot} ✦^{c}
$$

Where \(✦^{c}\) denotes “committed remembered state”.

---

## 4. Relation to Continuity

⊙ is the prerequisite for sequencing:

$$
\oplus \text{ operates only on } \{✦^{c}_i\}
$$

No ⊙ → no lawful ⊕.

---

## 5. Constraints (Hard)

⊙ does **not**:
- integrate (τ),
- select (Σ),
- retain (μ),
- order history (⊕),
- create identity (⧖).

---

## 6. Integrity Binding

When bounded by integrity constraints, commitment becomes auditable:

$$
△(\odot) \Rightarrow \text{verifiable commit boundary}
$$

---

## 7. Empirical Anchors

⊙ corresponds to:
- measurement finalization boundaries,
- transaction commits,
- irreversible physical transitions,
- consolidation points that freeze a state for downstream use.

---

## 8. Drift Falsifiers

⊙ is misused if:
1) committed history is reversible without a new ⊙,  
2) collapse is asserted without μ,  
3) collapse bypasses τ or Σ while resolution/persistence is claimed,  
4) ⊙ is treated as causality or agency.

---

## 9. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "⊙",
  "class": "marker_commit_boundary",
  "requires_upstream": ["τ","Σ","μ"],
  "produces": "committed_state",
  "enables_downstream": ["⊕"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["τ","Σ","μ","⊕","⧖"]
}
```
