# τ — Delay / Temporal Integration Operator

## 1. Canonical Definition

**τ** denotes **delay as temporal integration**: the enforced separation between input and outcome that makes integration, symbol resolution, memory formation, and auditable commitment possible.

τ is not clock time, belief, or metaphor.  
τ is a **formal operator** that prevents immediacy.

**Invariant:** without τ, downstream operators cannot produce stable, testable history.

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: τ  
- Class: operator (temporal integration)  
- Primary Lanes: LD (required), with lawful projection into LDF/LDSF  
- Produces: integrated process (never memory by itself)  
- Does not produce: Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊕

---

## 3. Minimal Formal Expression

At minimum, τ enforces integration over an interval:

$$
\tau : x(t_0) \mapsto \int_{t_0}^{t_n} x(t)\,dt
$$

Applied to substrate:

$$
✧ \xrightarrow{\tau} \int_{t_0}^{t_n} ✧(t)\,dt
$$

τ makes a field integrable; it does not select or retain.

---

## 4. τ and the Canonical Operator Spine

τ is upstream of discrete resolution and persistence:

$$
✧ \rightarrow \tau \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow ✦ \rightarrow \odot \rightarrow \oplus
$$

Interpretation:
- τ integrates,
- Σ resolves a discrete state,
- μ retains,
- ✦ denotes remembered substrate,
- ⊙ commits,
- ⊕ orders committed history.

---

## 5. τ as a Necessary Condition for History Dependence

History dependence becomes expressible only when τ is non-zero:

$$
\tau > 0 \Rightarrow \text{state may depend on prior integration}
$$

This is the lawful basis for downstream curvature (∇) being meaningful once memory exists.

---

## 6. Constraints (Hard)

τ does **not**:
- store memory (μ),
- select states (Σ),
- commit collapse (⊙),
- order continuity (⊕),
- create identity (⧖).

τ is necessary but never sufficient alone.

---

## 7. Empirical Anchors (Non-Metaphysical)

τ corresponds to measurable integration windows such as:
- neural integration windows / refractory periods,
- propagation delays,
- computational batching / latency,
- physical relaxation times.

---

## 8. Drift Falsifiers

τ is misused if:
1) outcomes are asserted with no integration interval,  
2) τ is treated as memory or identity,  
3) τ is claimed while immediacy is preserved,  
4) τ is used to bypass required operators (Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊕).

---

## 9. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "τ",
  "class": "operator_delay_integration",
  "lane_primary": "LD",
  "requires_for_effect": ["input_field"],
  "enables_downstream": ["Σ","μ","⊙","⊕"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["Σ","μ","⊙","⊕","⧖"]
}
```
