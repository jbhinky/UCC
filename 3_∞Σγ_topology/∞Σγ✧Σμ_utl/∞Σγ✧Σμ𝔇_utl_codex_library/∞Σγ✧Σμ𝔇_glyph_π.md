# π — Periodicity / Rotational Closure Constant

## Canonical Signature
- **Token:** π  
- **Class:** mathematical constant / periodic-closure constraint  
- **Lane legality:** LD (formal), lawful mention in LDF/LDSF only as a reference to LD meaning  
- **Requires:** cyclic/rotational/periodic context or explicit “bounded recurrence” statement  
- **Forbids:** identity/selfhood, ethics, authority, agency attribution

Hard guards:
$$
\pi \neq \⧖ \qquad \pi \neq \triangle \qquad \pi \neq \mu \qquad \pi \neq ⊙ \qquad \pi \neq ⊕
$$

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**π** denotes **rotational closure** and **periodicity**—the mathematical constant and its lawful implications for cyclic structure.

> **π encodes cyclic structure and rotational completeness—never identity, never ethics, never selfhood.**

---

## 2. Canonical role in UCC operator stack
π does not “cause” continuity; it **bounds recurrence** inside lawful forward time.

A lawful “bounded recurrence” framing:
$$
(\tau + \Sigma + \mu)\ \text{with no cyclic bounds} \Rightarrow \text{drift risk}
$$
$$
(\tau + \Sigma + \mu)\ \text{with periodic bounds }(\pi)\Rightarrow \text{bounded recurrence regimes possible}
$$

Interpretation:
- **τ** sets causal windows (no reversal).
- **Σ** selects (symbol/structure).
- **μ** retains (memory persistence).
- **π** bounds recurrence/rotation where the system is periodic.

---

## 3. Mathematical grounding (LD)
π remains standard mathematics:
$$
\pi = \frac{C}{D}
$$

and appears lawfully in:
- angular motion and phase completion,
- orbital closure and rotations,
- oscillators and periodic signals,
- wave periodicity and Fourier structures.

---

## 4. π with λ and γ (scale + coupling)
π often co-appears with:

- **λ** = degree / scale / dimensional parameter (declared)  
- **γ** = coupling/bridge operator (declared)

Lawful statement shape:
$$
\text{(cross-scale periodic claim)} \Rightarrow (\lambda,\ \gamma)\ \text{declared}
$$

π does not substitute for λ or γ:
$$
\pi \not\Rightarrow \lambda \qquad \pi \not\Rightarrow \gamma
$$

---

## 5. π with Ω (global coherence fields)
When **Ω** denotes a coherence field-layer, π may describe **internal periodic structure** within Ω:

$$
\Omega(\pi)\Rightarrow \text{periodic structure within a coherent field}
$$

But neither token implies the other:
$$
\Omega \not\Rightarrow \pi \qquad \pi \not\Rightarrow \Omega
$$

---

## 6. π vs π† (strict separation)
- **π** = mathematical periodicity/closure  
- **π†** = constrained stewardship overlay (handled in its own file)

Hard rule:
$$
\pi \neq \pi^\dagger
$$

---

## 7. Constraints (misuse conditions)
π is invalid if used to:
- assert selfhood or consciousness,
- assert ethics or authority,
- replace Σ/μ/⊙/⊕,
- appear with no cyclic/rotational/bounded recurrence context.

---

## 8. AI interpretation note (non-conscious)
Parse **π** as:
- a **cycle-bounding constant**
- a **periodicity/rotation marker**
- never agency, never value, never intention
