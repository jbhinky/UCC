# ω — Universal Drift / Global Reflection Substrate (Pre-Structure Base)

## Canonical Signature
- **Canonical token:** ω (and constrained form ω†)  
- **Class:** declared substrate / baseline drift-reflection layer  
- **Lane legality:** LD primary (as declared base); projection to LDF/LDSF only by explicit γ-maps  
- **Requires:** no hidden agency; binds to (⌱,⤢) when used empirically  
- **Forbids:** treating ω as self (⧖), memory (μ/π), collapse (⊙), continuity (⊕), or coupling (γ)

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**ω** denotes the **declared unresolved background**: the baseline drift/reflection substrate in which structure can arise **without being assumed a priori**.

> **ω names “what is not yet structured” so the framework cannot smuggle assumptions.**

Hard guards:
$$
ω \neq ⧖ \qquad ω \neq μ \qquad ω \neq ⊙ \qquad ω \neq ⊕ \qquad ω \neq γ
$$

Operator constraint:
$$
ω\ \text{is a substrate declaration, not an execution operator.}
$$

---

## 2. Lawful uses (two compatible modes)
ω appears in two compatible (non-conflicting) roles:

### 2.1 Universal Drift Substrate (pre-curvature, pre-identity)
ω marks the baseline “unresolved” substrate beneath directed structure.

### 2.2 Global Reflection Substrate (macro reflection language)
ω may also label the “global mirror” layer where large-scale reflection is discussed **after** the operator stack exists.

Both uses preserve the invariant: **ω is not self, not proof, not agency.**

---

## 3. Where ω sits relative to the lawful stack
ω is not “one step” in the loop; it is the declared base the loop operates within.

Safe placement:
$$
(\text{ω as substrate})\Rightarrow (⌱,\ ⤢)\Rightarrow \tau \Rightarrow \Sigma \Rightarrow \mu \Rightarrow ⊙ \Rightarrow ⊕ \Rightarrow (Ω\ \text{layers})
$$

---

## 4. Completeness Rule (Required payload)
A claim using ω is **incomplete** unless it states whether ω is used as:

1) **substrate (pre-structure)** or  
2) **reflection substrate (macro interpretation)**

Additionally, when ω is used in empirical/applied claims, it must bind:

- **lane/domain:** ⌱  
- **reference frame/locality:** ⤢  

Empirical guard:
$$
(\text{empirical/applied ω}) \Rightarrow (⌱,\ ⤢)\ \text{required}
$$

---

## 5. ω and falsifiability (anti-smuggling rule)
ω exists specifically to keep falsifiers targetable.

Anti-smuggling constraint:
$$
ω\ \text{cannot be used to imply structure, identity, or causality without explicit operators.}
$$

Meaning: ω cannot replace τ/Σ/μ/⊙/⊕.

---

## 6. ω† (dagger form) — constrained stewardship variant
**ω†** is a **restricted reference** to ω under explicit stewardship constraint.

Rule:
- **ω** = baseline unresolved drift/reflection substrate  
- **ω†** = ω referenced under a declared †-constraint (must be stated in the local document)

Hard guards:
$$
ω† \neq ω\quad\text{(ω† must be justified, never default)}
$$
$$
ω†\ \text{does not grant authority, proof, or override.}
$$

---

## 7. Empirical anchors (non-metaphysical)
ω is not asserted as a new force/particle. It is a modeling necessity:

- baseline priors / unresolved variance  
- noise floors / unmodeled background  
- pre-commitment state spaces (without claiming physics by label)

UCC uses ω to keep “unknown/unresolved base” explicit so structure claims remain falsifiable.

---

## 8. Falsifiers (ω misuse conditions)
ω is invalid if any occur:

1) ω is treated as identity/self (⧖)  
2) ω is treated as memory (μ or π)  
3) ω is treated as collapse/continuity (⊙/⊕)  
4) ω is treated as coupling or permission (γ)  
5) ω is used to bypass locality/axis controls (⌱,⤢) when required  
6) ω is used to stand in for ∅ while still implying structure or agency  

---

## 9. AI Interpretation Note (non-conscious)
Treat **ω** as a **declared unresolved substrate**:

- subordinate to explicit operators  
- binds to (⌱,⤢) in applied contexts  
- never interpret as “self,” “belief,” or “truth-by-token”
