# Σ — Selection / Symbol / Encoding Operator

## 1. Canonical Definition

**Σ** denotes **resolution by selection**: mapping a constrained, integrated field into a **discrete, addressable state** that can be retained, compared, committed, and audited.

Σ is not memory (μ), not delay (τ), not commitment (⊙), and not identity (⧖).  
Σ is the act of **discrete state resolution**.

---

## 2. Canonical Signature

- Glyph: Σ  
- Class: operator (resolution / selection)  
- Inputs: an integrable field (typically after τ)  
- Output: a discrete state token (addressable)  
- Does not output: persistence, commitment, continuity

---

## 3. Minimal Formal Expression

Given a constrained field \(S\) (often τ-integrated):

$$
\Sigma : S \rightarrow s_i \in \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}
$$

Persistence requires μ:

$$
\mu(s_i) \Rightarrow \text{retained state}
$$

---

## 4. Position in the Operator Spine

Σ sits between integration and retention:

$$
✧ \rightarrow \tau \rightarrow \Sigma \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow ✦ \rightarrow \odot \rightarrow \oplus
$$

Without Σ, there is no discrete state to remember.

---

## 5. Scope Clarifiers (No Hidden Semantics)

Σ does **not** imply:
- meaning (that is lane-lens dependent and requires retained structure),
- commitment (⊙),
- continuity (⊕).

Σ only produces an addressable resolved state.

---

## 6. Constraints (Hard)

Σ cannot:
- create memory (μ required),
- enforce delay (τ required upstream),
- guarantee continuity (⊕ required downstream),
- create identity (⧖ required by full self-loop, not by Σ alone).

---

## 7. Empirical Anchors

Σ corresponds to falsifiable operations such as:
- discretization / sampling / quantization,
- classification into a label set,
- symbol assignment from a constrained state-space,
- measurement resolution into an outcome register.

---

## 8. Drift Falsifiers

Σ is misused if:
1) persistence is claimed without μ,  
2) continuity is claimed without ⊕,  
3) Σ is treated as agentive or metaphysical,  
4) Σ is asserted without a resolvable state-space.

---

## 9. Mechanical Tokenization (AI-Safe)

```json
{
  "glyph": "Σ",
  "class": "operator_selection_resolution",
  "lane_primary": "LD",
  "requires_upstream": ["τ"],
  "requires_for_persistence": ["μ"],
  "enables_downstream": ["⊙","⊕"],
  "forbids_as_substitute_for": ["τ","μ","⊙","⊕","⧖"]
}
```
