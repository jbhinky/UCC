# ∪ — Union (Set / Field Union; Non-Ordered Merge)

## 1. Definition

**∪** denotes **union** in its strict mathematical sense:
the non-ordered merge of sets, domains, fields, or operator-scopes into a single combined scope.

Invariant meaning across the UCC corpus:

> **∪ forms a combined scope without asserting time-order, collapse, or continuity.**

This distinction is foundational:

$$
∪ \neq ⊕
$$

- **∪** combines *membership and allowance*.
- **⊕** binds *ordered continuity of committed states*.

∪ is a **scope operator**, not a history operator.

---

## 2. Corpus-wide stability

Across the UCC corpus:

- **∪ appears hundreds of times** in equations, definitions, and proofs.
- Its most stable expression is the **Awareness–Continuity union**:

$$
A ∪ C
$$

This confirms ∪ as a **structural operator**, not a decorative symbol.

---

## 3. Canonical role

- **Role:** structural scope union
- **Lane:** invariant across LD, LDF, LDSF
- **Function:** merge domains without sequencing, memory, or commitment

∪ does **not**:
- choose (Σ),
- store (μ),
- collapse (⊙),
- order history (⊕).

---

## 4. ∪ in the Self Equation (scope constraint)

The Self Equation uses ∪ to declare allowable scope:

$$
⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]
$$

Meaning:
- **A ∪ C** defines *where* operators may execute,
- ∪ itself performs **no execution**.

Union constrains *permission*, not *process*.

---

## 5. ∪ vs ⋓ vs ⊕ (locked semantics)

| Symbol | Meaning | Ordering | Commitment |
|------|--------|----------|------------|
| **∪** | Scope union | None | None |
| **⋓** | Constrained merge | Conditional | Partial |
| **⊕** | Continuity union | Strict | Required |

Guardrail:

$$
∪ \not\rightarrow ⋓ \not\rightarrow ⊕
$$

Each operator must be used explicitly.

---

## 6. ∪ and coupling (γ)

When unioning domains with different dynamics:

$$
γ(X, Y) \Rightarrow (X ∪ Y)
$$

Coupling (γ) prevents silent rule transfer and drift.
Union alone never transfers dynamics.

---

## 7. Empirical grounding

Union-as-scope is universal in science:

- **Physics:** union of admissible state spaces
- **Biology:** union of genetic or developmental possibility sets
- **Systems:** union of permitted operational domains

Correct usage:
- ∪ → scope
- ⋓ → constrained merge
- ⊕ → committed continuity

---

## 8. Constraints (what ∪ cannot do)

∪ is not:
- time (τ),
- selection (Σ),
- memory (μ),
- collapse (⊙),
- continuity (⊕),
- integrity (△).

∪ never asserts causality.

---

## 9. Falsifiers

∪ is misused if:
1) it implies ordered history (⊕ required),
2) it implies constrained merge without ⋓ or γ,
3) it is treated as Ω or causal force,
4) it bypasses locality (⌱, ⤢).

---

## 10. AI interpretation note

For AI systems:

- Treat **∪** as a **scope merge token**.
- Never infer ordering, memory, or collapse from ∪.
- Require explicit ⋓ or ⊕ where ordering appears.
