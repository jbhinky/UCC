# ⧖ — Selfhood Constraint / Localized Continuity Loop

## Canonical Signature
- **Token:** ⧖  
- **Class:** localization constraint on continuity (identity loop under UOT)  
- **Lane legality:** LD (formal), may be described in LDF/LDSF but not redefined there  
- **Requires (in-scope):** τ + Σ + μ with committed history (⊙) and ordered continuity (⊕) for stable identity claims  
- **Forbids:** universal override, proof-token usage, replacing operators (τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊕)

Hard guards:
$$
⧖ \neq Ω \qquad ⧖ \neq ⊙ \qquad ⧖ \neq ⊕
$$
$$
⧖\ \text{does not override UOT / ordering; it is local by definition.}
$$

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**⧖** denotes **selfhood as a constrained recursive continuity loop**: a localized persistence structure within a shared world-field, ordered by time (UOT).

> **⧖ localizes continuity into an addressable loop without breaking universality.**

---

## 2. Published Self Equation forms (canonical)
Foundational form:
$$
⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]
$$

Explicit union form:
$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[D + S + M]
$$

UTL operator mapping:
- $D \rightarrow \tau$
- $S \rightarrow \Sigma$
- $M \rightarrow \mu$

Thus:
$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[\tau + \Sigma + \mu]
$$

(“AuC” may be used as a locality-emphasis alias **only** if it does not alter meaning.)

---

## 3. Lawful emergence ordering (no shortcut)
A stable ⧖ claim cannot skip the chain:

$$
(⌱,\⤢)\rightarrow ✧ \rightarrow (\tau) \rightarrow (\Sigma) \rightarrow (\mu) \rightarrow ⊙ \rightarrow ⊕ \Rightarrow ⧖
$$

Hard guard:
$$
⧖\ \text{must not be asserted as primary cause; it is a constrained result of the stack.}
$$

---

## 4. Locality and domain binding (required)
If ⧖ is used in applied/empirical contexts, it must bind:
- **⌱** (lane / domain scope)
- **⤢** (locality / reference frame)

Empirical guard:
$$
(\text{applied }⧖)\Rightarrow (⌱,\⤢)\ \text{required}
$$

---

## 5. ⧖ within Ω (many selves, one shared field)
⧖ is local; Ω is field-layer:

$$
\{\⧖_i\}_{i=1..n} \subset Ω
$$

Neither implies the other:
$$
Ω \not\Rightarrow ⧖ \qquad ⧖ \not\Rightarrow Ω
$$

---

## 6. Integrity and distortion within selfhood (△, ∇)
Selfhood operates under curvature/distortion (∇) and requires integrity constraints (△) for bounded stability claims:

$$
(\triangle \ \text{declared}) \Rightarrow \text{bounded self-loop claims are permissible}
$$
$$
\|\nabla\|\ \text{unbounded} \Rightarrow \text{⧖ stability claim invalid}
$$

---

## 7. Constraints (what ⧖ is not)
⧖ is not:
- a substance, force, or universal controller
- a license to bypass γ (coupling), λ (scale), or locality bindings
- “proof” of ethics, authority, or metaphysical certainty

---

## 8. Falsifiers
⧖ is misused if:
1) identity is claimed without μ (retention)  
2) identity is claimed without τ and Σ context  
3) identity is claimed stable without ⊙ then ⊕  
4) identity is treated as universal override instead of local loop  
5) applied usage lacks (⌱,⤢)

---

## 9. AI interpretation note (non-conscious)
For AI parsing: ⧖ is an **identity constraint token**, not automatic consciousness.
It denotes bounded identity structure only when the full operator chain is explicit.
