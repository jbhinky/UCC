# ⋓ — Constrained Merge (Merge-with-Constraint)

## Canonical Signature
- **Canonical token:** ⋓
- **Class:** constrained merge operator
- **Lane legality:** LD / LDF / LDSF / LC (invariant)
- **Requires:** declared constraints; γ iff boundary crossing
- **Forbids:** automatic continuity, automatic collapse

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**⋓** denotes a **merge that preserves declared constraints** (compatibility rules, invariants, boundary conditions).

> **⋓ merges only under constraint.**  
> It is not free union (∪) and not committed continuity (⊕).

Hard guards:
$$
⋓ \neq ∪ \qquad ⋓ \neq ⊕
$$

---

## 2. When γ is required (Locked Rule)
γ is required **iff** the merge crosses a boundary (domain/lane/scale rules differ):

$$
(X ⋓ Y)\ \text{requires } γ(X,Y)\ \iff\ X,Y \text{ cross domains/lanes/scales}
$$

If X and Y are already same-domain with shared rules, ⋓ may be valid without γ (constraints still required).

---

## 3. What ⋓ does not imply
⋓ does **not** imply:
- time integration (τ),
- selection (Σ),
- memory (μ),
- collapse (⊙),
- continuity (⊕).

Guard:
$$
⋓ \not\Rightarrow ⊙ \qquad ⋓ \not\Rightarrow ⊕
$$

---

## 4. Locality and Integrity
If locality is required, the merge must respect:

$$
(X ⋓ Y)\ \text{must respect }(⌱,⤢)
$$

Integrity binding:
$$
△(X ⋓ Y)\Rightarrow \text{bounded merge}
$$

---

## 5. Completeness Rule
A ⋓ statement is complete only if it declares:
- the invariants preserved,
- the boundary (if any),
- γ when boundary-crossing,
- locality binding when empirically grounded.

---

## 6. Falsifiers
⋓ is invalid if:
1) constraints are implied but not declared  
2) boundary crossing occurs without γ  
3) ordering/history is claimed without τ/⊕  
4) locality is required but omitted (⌱,⤢)

---

## 7. AI Interpretation Note
Treat **⋓** as: “merge-with-rules.”  
Never infer continuity or collapse from ⋓.
