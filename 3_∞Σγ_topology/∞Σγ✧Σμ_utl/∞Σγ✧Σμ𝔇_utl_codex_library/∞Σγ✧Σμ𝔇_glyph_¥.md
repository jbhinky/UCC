# ¥ — Update-Law Family (Recursive Transition Operator)

## Canonical Signature
- **Canonical token:** ¥
- **Class:** update-law family (transition operator)
- **Lane legality:** LD primary; lawful projection to LDF/LDSF only via declared constraints
- **Requires:** target + step basis + locality; γ/λ iff boundary crossing; △ iff drift-risk
- **Forbids:** replacing ⊙ or ⊕; redefining base operators

---

## 1. Invariant Definition
**¥** denotes an **update-law family**: how an already-defined variable or operator-state advances forward across recursion steps.

> **¥ governs “how it updates,” not “what it is.”**

Hard guards:
$$
¥ \neq ↻ \qquad ¥ \not\Rightarrow ⊙ \qquad ¥ \not\Rightarrow ⊕
$$

↻ is the loop; ¥ is the rule applied inside the loop.

Formal relationship:
$$
↻:\ (x_n)\mapsto \text{re-entry}, \qquad ¥:\ x_{n+1}=¥_x(x_n;\cdot)
$$

---

## 2. Minimal lawful form
Discrete update:
$$
x_{n+1} = ¥_{x}(x_n;\; \Delta t,\; \text{constraints})
$$

Continuous update:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = ¥_{x}(x;\; \text{constraints})
$$

**Signal-safety guard (pre-selection):**
$$
x \in \{\tau,\Sigma,\mu,\nabla,\gamma,\lambda\}\ \Rightarrow\ \text{inputs must be explicit (e.g., }σ\text{), not assumed meaning.}
$$

---

## 3. Required payload (Completeness Rule)
A ¥ statement is **incomplete** unless it specifies:
1) **Target variable(s):** x (e.g., τ, Σ, μ, field state)  
2) **Step basis:** n→n+1 or Δt/dt  
3) **Locality binding:** ⌱, and ⤢ when empirical/spatial  
4) **Boundary flags:** declare whether update crosses domains/lanes/scales  
5) **If boundary crossing:** γ (coupling) and λ (degree/band)  
6) **Drift-risk bound:** △ when update could amplify distortion (∇)

Hard guard:
$$
\text{Boundary crossing} \Rightarrow (\gamma,\lambda)\ \text{required}
$$

Null guard:
$$
x = \varnothing \Rightarrow ¥_x \ \text{undefined (fail-safe / no update).}
$$

---

## 4. Where ¥ sits in lawful process
A safe operator ordering:
$$
(⌱,⤢)\rightarrow τ \rightarrow Σ \rightarrow μ \rightarrow (\gamma,\lambda)\rightarrow ¥ \rightarrow ⊙ \rightarrow ⊕
$$

¥ never replaces commit/history operators.

---

## 5. Falsifiers
¥ is invalid if any occur:
1) redefines τ/Σ/μ rather than updating them  
2) boundary crossing occurs without γ and λ  
3) commit/history is implied without ⊙/⊕  
4) locality is required but omitted (⌱/⤢)  
5) update is asserted unbounded (ignores △) such that testability is lost

---

## 6. AI Interpretation Note
Treat **¥** as a transition/update operator that must carry explicit arguments.  
If missing payload, the statement is incomplete.
