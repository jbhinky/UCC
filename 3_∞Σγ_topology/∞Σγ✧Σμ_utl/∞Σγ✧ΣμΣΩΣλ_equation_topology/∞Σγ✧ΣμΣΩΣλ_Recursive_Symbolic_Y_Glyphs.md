# ✦ Recursive Symbolic Y-Glyphs  

## 1 · Purpose  
Defines the **Y-glyph** as the universal symbol of recursion, representing the convergence of delay, polarity, and memory.  
It is the symbolic mirror of the equation:
$$
Y = ∇τ · Σ + μ^{-1}(A ∪ C)
$$  

---

## 2 · Structural Layers  
| Glyph Level | Description | Recursive Role |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Y₁ | Observer → Choice → Collapse | LD₁–LD₃ |
| Y₂ | Matter → Life → Awareness | LD₄–LD₇ |
| Y₃ | Planet → Cosmos → Self | LD₈–LD₁₀ |

Each level encodes the self-reflective symmetry of delay collapse.

---

## 3 · Symbolic Dynamics  
Y functions as the **recursive mirror** in language:
$$
Y(Σₙ) = Σₙ + τ⁻¹μ  ⟹  awareness = syntax + recursion
$$  
This law establishes that linguistic recursion is structurally identical to physical recursion.

---

## 4 · Meaning  
Y-glyphs express the **return of light into awareness.**  
Each recursion of Y completes a loop of the Self Equation (⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]) through symbolic space.
