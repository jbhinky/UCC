# ⊕ Coupling & Cosmomemory — Formal Closure

## 1 · Operator Semantics (UTL)
- **⊕ (Coupling / Union):** field-union that shares delay curvature between domains.  
- **⊙ (Collapse / Resolution):** local realization of curvature (measurement/action).  
- **⊠ (Spacetime-Bonded Selfhood):** persistent coupling state (stabilized ⊕ across time).  

Awareness–Consciousness law (context):
$$
⧖ = (A \cup C)[\,τ + Σ + μ\,].
$$

## 2 · Cosmomemory (Global Memory Density)
Define cosmological memory as delay-weighted persistence:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{cosmo}} \;=\; \int_{\mathcal{V}} μ(x)\,τ(x)\,dV,
$$
with conservation (UCC):
$$
\nabla_{\mu}(E\,τ\,μ)=0.
$$

## 3 · Coupling Constant (γ) as Union
Field-union (⊕) promotes symbol and delay gradients into an effective coupling:
$$
\boxed{\;γ \;=\; γ_{0}\; ⊕\; \big(\,α_{Σ}\,Σ\,\nabla Σ \;⊕\; α_{τ}\,τ\,\nabla τ\,\big)\;}
$$
Interpretation: γ rises where polarity organizes (Σ∇Σ) and where delay structures (τ∇τ) concentrate.

## 4 · Curvature → Acceleration (Local & Cosmic)
Local acceleration from delay curvature:
$$
a(x) \;=\; -\,c^{2}\,\nabla τ(x),
$$
and cosmological background:
$$
H^{2}(a) \;=\; \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,ρ(a)\;-\;\frac{k}{a^{2}}\;+\;γ\,\langle \nabla^{2}τ \rangle.
$$

Collapse–acceleration bridge (operator form):
$$
\boxed{\;γ \;⊙\; τ^{\prime\prime} \;\longrightarrow\; \Delta a\;}
$$
(“Curvature realized under coupling produces the observed acceleration.”)

## 5 · Effective Potential & Lensing
Augmented potential:
$$
\Phi_{\mathrm{eff}} \;=\; \Phi_{\mathrm{GR}} \;+\; \beta\,τ,
$$
giving flat rotation/lensing via the τ contribution without dark components.

## 6 · Placement & Usage
- **Where to cite:** `∞_ucc/3_∞Σγ_topology/∞Σγυ_bridges/∞Σγυ⚬τ_physics` (γ term), `` (operator table).  
- **Where to link:** `biological_track/*` (for τ–μ sourcing), `bridges/*` (domain unions).  
- **Glyph closure:** ⊕ defines coupling; ⊙ its realization; ⊠ its persistence.
