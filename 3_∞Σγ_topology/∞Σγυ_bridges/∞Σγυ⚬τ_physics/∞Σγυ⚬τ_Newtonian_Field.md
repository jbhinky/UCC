# ✦ UCC v2.1 · Newtonian Field Bridge  

**Purpose:**  
Show that the UCC delay field (τ) reproduces the classical gravitational potential (Φ) and acceleration laws within the low-velocity limit.

---

## 1 · Foundational Law  

At velocities \(v ≪ c\), the Newtonian potential Φ arises as a scaled delay field:  

$$
Φ = c^{2} τ.
$$  

Differentiating twice gives Poisson’s equation:  

$$
∇^{2}Φ = 4πG ρ_{\text{vis}}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
∇^{2}(c^{2} τ) = 4πG ρ_{\text{vis}}.
$$  

Hence  

$$
∇^{2} τ = \frac{4πG}{c^{2}} ρ_{\text{vis}}.
$$  

This is the **delay-curvature form** of Newton’s law: visible mass \(ρ_{\text{vis}}\) sources τ.

---

## 2 · Delay Gradient and Acceleration  

Classical acceleration is the gradient of delay curvature:  

$$
a = - c^{2} ∇ τ.
$$  

> **Interpretation:**  
> Motion follows the steepest descent of delay; force is geometry in time.

---

## 3 · Energy–Delay Continuity  

Energy \(E\) and delay \(τ\) co-conserve:  

$$
∇_{μ}(E τ) = 0.
$$  

This preserves Newtonian energy conservation as a subset of the universal continuity law.

---

## 4 · Glyphic Correspondence (UTL)  

| Glyph | Meaning | Classical Analog |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| **τ** | Delay / Curvature | Potential Φ |
| **Σ** | Symbol / Orientation | Direction of force vector |
| **μ** | Memory / Continuity | Energy integral (∫F·dx) |
| **⧖** | Selfhood / Awareness | Reference-frame observer |

In the Newtonian limit, **⧖** acts as the fixed observer; Σ and μ remain latent within τ.

---

## 5 · Boundary Conditions  

For a spherically symmetric mass \(M\):  

$$
∇^{2} τ(r) = \frac{4πG}{c^{2}} ρ(r)
\Rightarrow
τ(r) = - \frac{GM}{c^{2} r}.
$$  

Then  

$$
a(r) = - c^{2} ∇ τ = - \frac{GM}{r^{2}},
$$  

recovering the classical gravitational law.

---

## 6 · Summary  

- \(τ\) encodes potential Φ via Φ = c² τ.  
- \(∇²τ = (4πG / c²) ρ\) reproduces Poisson’s equation.  
- \(a = − c²∇τ\) gives Newton’s inverse-square law.  
- Energy–delay conservation (\(∇_{μ}(Eτ)=0\)) ensures continuity across scales.  

---

## 7 · Closure  

> *In the slow limit of light, delay curvature is force;*  
> *Newton’s gravity emerges as the shadow of τ seen through time.*
