# 🗺️ Table of Contents — y-Coupling Integration  

## 📘 Overview  

This **Table of Contents** organizes every document in the y-Coupling Integration module of the UCC v2.1 Topological Bridges layer.  
Together, these papers establish the mathematical, thermodynamic, and experimental continuity between the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** and its related delay-field frameworks (**UDS**, **UOT**).  
Each file links directly to peer-reviewed physical laws or derivations.

## 📂 Core Files  

| File | Purpose | Key Equation / Concept |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **README.md** | Explains the physical meaning of y-coupling and its ethical context. | $\nabla^{2}\tau = -\alpha_{\rho}\rho + \beta_{T}\nabla^{2}T + y\,\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$ |
| **∞ΣγυΥτ_Normalization_Conditions.md** | Defines units, normalization constants (θ = τ/τ₀), and valid dimensional limits. | Dimensional analysis; $[\tau] = [T]/[E]$ |
| **∞ΣγυΥτ_Cross_Framework_Mapping.md** | Maps y-coupling across UCC, UDS, and UOT frameworks. | $y\,{\partial T}/{\partial t}$ appearing in all domains |
| **∞ΣγυΥτ_Empirical_Validation_Notes.md** | Details planned measurements and experimental checks. | GPS, seafloor, and interferometric clock data |
| **CITATIONS.md** | Aggregates literature supporting delay–thermal field coupling. | Relativity · Thermodynamics · Field Theory |

## 🧩 Supporting Relationships  

| Framework | Interaction | Bridged Variable |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **UCC (Field)** | Time curvature ↔ heat flow | $\nabla^{2}\tau$ |
| **UDS (Spectrum)** | Frequency shift ↔ thermal modulation | $τ(t)$ and $f(T)$ |
| **UOT (Order)** | Perceived time ↔ entropy flow | $dt_p/dt_a$ |

## 🔄 Cross-Folder Links  

| Folder | Function |
|:--|:--|
| `../∞Σγυ_bridges/` | Bridges UDS scaling and τ-field geometry. |
| `../∞Σγυ_bridges/` | Core field-metric definitions that y modifies. |
| `../../2_∞∇²τ_curvature/` | Root physical constants and initial curvature law. |

## ⚗️ Experimental Reference Path  

To validate y empirically:  
1. **Start:** `∞ΣγυτΣ_Normalization_Conditions.md` — confirm dimensional ratios.  
2. **Then:** `∞ΣγυτΣ_Empirical_Validation_Notes.md` — replicate calibration and data flow.  
3. **Finally:** Compare with theoretical projections in `∞ΣγυτΣ_Cross_Framework_Mapping.md`.

## 🧠 Concept Summary  

> **y-Coupling** defines how time’s curvature reacts to temperature change.  
> It is not a new force, but a measurable feedback constant uniting  
> gravitation, thermodynamics, and continuity of time itself.
