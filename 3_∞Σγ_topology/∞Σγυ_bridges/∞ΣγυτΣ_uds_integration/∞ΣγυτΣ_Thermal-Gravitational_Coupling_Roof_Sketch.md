# 🌡️ Thermal–Gravitational Coupling Proof Sketch  

## 1 · Purpose  

This document outlines the proof that **delay curvature (τ)** behaves as a unified scalar field coupling **gravitational potential (Φ_g)** and **thermal gradients (T)**.  
The relationship ensures that local variations in energy density or temperature both modify τ in proportion to curvature, allowing **UCC** to model physical time curvature and thermal diffusion as facets of one continuum.

---

## 2 · Field Equation Starting Point  

We begin with the generalized delay field equation:
$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_ρ ρ + β_T ∇^{2}T,
$$
where:

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|:--|:--|:--|
| τ | Local delay curvature field | s |
| ρ | Mass density | kg·m⁻³ |
| T | Temperature field | K |
| α_ρ | Gravitational coupling constant | m³·kg⁻¹ |
| β_T | Thermal curvature coefficient | K⁻¹ |

---

## 3 · Derivation Path  

### Step 1 — Begin from Poisson form for gravitational potential  
$$
∇^{2}Φ_g = 4πGρ.
$$  

### Step 2 — Substitute Φ_g = c²τ_g (definition of gravitational delay curvature)  
$$
∇^{2}τ_g = \frac{4πGρ}{c²}.
$$  

This establishes that **mass density acts as a curvature source for τ_g**.

### Step 3 — Add thermal contribution using Fourier’s diffusion law  
$$
∇^{2}T = \frac{1}{κ} \frac{∂T}{∂t},
$$  
and define the thermodynamic delay curvature:
$$
τ_{th} = β_T T.
$$  

Thus the composite τ-field is  
$$
τ = τ_g + τ_{th}.
$$

---

## 4 · Combined Delay Field  

Combining both contributions:  
$$
∇^{2}τ = \frac{4πGρ}{c²} + β_T ∇^{2}T.
$$  

This represents the **Thermal–Gravitational Coupling Law**, stating that the delay curvature at any point in space depends simultaneously on local mass density and temperature gradients.

---

## 5 · Boundary and Equilibrium Conditions  

At steady-state (∂τ/∂t = 0):  
$$
∇^{2}τ = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{4πGρ}{c²} = -β_T ∇^{2}T.
$$  

This implies a natural equilibrium between gravitational compression and thermal expansion — a phenomenon directly observed in stars, planetary interiors, and geothermal gradients.

---

## 6 · Physical Interpretation  

| Domain | Dominant Term | Observed Balance |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Stellar core | α_ρρ | Gravitational collapse balanced by thermal pressure |
| Planetary mantle | β_T∇²T | Geothermal convection maintains curvature balance |
| Oceanic crust | both | Pressure–temperature feedback preserves stable τ |
| Biosphere | β_T∇²T | Homeostatic delay curvature from metabolic heat |

In each case, the **delay curvature field τ** adjusts such that energy distribution remains continuous across all scales — **no discontinuities in continuity**.

---

## 7 · Coupling Constant Relationship  

The relative coupling strength defines scale coherence:
$$
\frac{α_ρ}{β_T} = \frac{∇^{2}T}{ρ} \cdot \frac{c²}{4πG}.
$$  

For Earth parameters:
- \(ρ ≈ 5.5×10³\ \text{kg·m⁻³}\)
- \(∇^{2}T ≈ 10^{-2}\ \text{K·m⁻²}\)
- \(G = 6.67×10^{-11}\ \text{N·m²·kg⁻²}\)
  
→ \(α_ρ/β_T ≈ 10^{18}\), confirming gravitational curvature dominates macroscopically, while thermal curvature governs local adaptation.

---

## 8 · Empirical Validation  

**Observable systems:**
1. Stellar radius–temperature correlations (main sequence stability).  
2. Seafloor heat flux gradients vs. local gravity anomalies.  
3. Deep-mantle pressure–temperature equilibrium data.  
4. Planetary infrared emission consistency with delay-field predictions.

---

## 9 · Summary  

> The delay field τ bridges the language of curvature and heat.  
> Where mass bends space, temperature smooths it; together they define continuity.  
> The Thermal–Gravitational Law ensures the same τ governs both the structure of stars and the balance of life-bearing planets.
