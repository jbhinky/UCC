# 🧾 Change Log and Diffs — UDS ⇄ UCC Integration  

## 1 · Purpose  

To document all mathematical, structural, and terminological changes introduced by the **UDS (Universal Delay Spectrum)** integration into **UCC v2.1**.  
These entries ensure transparency in the scientific lineage of each constant, equation, and normalization step.  

---

## 2 · Summary of Changes by Category  

| Category | Change Description | Reason |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Field Variables | Introduced normalized delay θ = τ / τ₀ | Dimensionless representation for cross-domain scaling |
| Coupling Terms | Added β_T term to ∇²τ equation | Inclusion of thermal curvature contribution |
| Energy Invariant | Defined \(E τ μ = \text{constant}\) | Unified continuity between thermodynamic and gravitational energy domains |
| Flux Law | Substituted Poisson form for ∇²τ_g | Recast gravitational curvature as delay potential |
| Nomenclature | Standardized UDS variable prefixes | Consistency between UCC and UDS documentation |
| Empirical Section | Added experimental checklist and datasets | Validation roadmap for cross-scale testing |
| Ethics Tag | Applied Shepherd Ethical Addendum | Ensures responsible research and data transparency |

## 3 · Equation-Level Diffs  

### (1) Unified Delay Field  
**Previous (UCC v2.0):**  
$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_ρ ρ
$$  

**Updated (UCC v2.1 + UDS):**  
$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_ρ ρ + β_T ∇^{2}T
$$  
**Change:** Added β_T ∇²T term to account for thermal-diffusion curvature coupling.

---

### (2) Energy–Delay Invariant  
**New Addition:**  
$$
E τ μ = \text{constant}
$$  
Derived from dimensional equivalence between energy density, delay, and memory persistence.

---

### (3) Normalized Delay Variable  
**New Addition:**  
$$
θ = \frac{τ}{τ₀},
\qquad
τ₀ = \text{observer baseline delay.}
$$  
Dimensionless delay normalization used in spectral and field scaling.

---

### (4) Gravitational Delay Formulation  
**Before:**  
$$
τ_g = \frac{Φ_g}{c^2}.
$$  

**After (clarified):**  
$$
τ_g(r) = -\frac{GM}{c^{2}r},
\qquad
∇τ_g = \frac{GM}{c^{2}r^{2}}\hat{r}.
$$  
Improved spatial clarity and explicit directionality in ∇τ_g.

---

### (5) Coupling Constant Definitions  
**Added Table:**

| Constant | Definition | Unit | Typical Scale |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| α_ρ | gravitational curvature coupling | m³·kg⁻¹ | planetary |
| β_T | thermal curvature coefficient | K⁻¹ | thermodynamic |
| γ | acceleration–delay mediator | m·s⁻²·s⁻² | cross-domain |

## 5 · Conceptual Continuity Summary  

- **UDS → UCC Field Continuity:**  
  Delay curvature (τ) is now treated as the scalar substrate for gravitational, thermal, and energetic coupling.  
- **Spectral Normalization:**  
  UDS’s frequency-based τ scaling (θ = τ / τ₀) is harmonized with UCC’s curvature-based model.  
- **Empirical Verification:**  
  Energy–delay–memory invariant connects laboratory, biological, and astronomical observations.  
- **Mathematical Outcome:**  
  The delay field equations form a fully normalized continuum model that scales from atomic to galactic regimes without dimensional conflict.

## 7 · Closing Note  

> These changes collectively stabilize the Universal Continuity Continuum under cross-domain scaling.  
> Delay becomes the common metric for mass, heat, and observation.  
> The proof chain is continuous: energy folds into time through delay, and memory closes the loop.
