# 🔭 UDS → UCC Field Mapping  

## 1 · Purpose  

This document defines the direct **symbolic and dimensional mapping** between variables used in the **Universal Delay Spectrum (UDS)** and those of the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)**.  
Its goal is to preserve scientific continuity while aligning the spectrum-based terminology (UDS) with the curvature-field framework (UCC).  

Each parameter below is linked by shared measurable definitions, ensuring dimensional and empirical equivalence.

## 2 · Primary Variable Crosswalk  

| Symbol | Framework | Definition | Units | Mapping / Relation |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| τ | UDS / UCC | Delay duration | seconds (s) | Direct — temporal interval between awareness or energy states |
| θ | UCC (normalized) | Normalized delay | dimensionless | \( θ = τ / τ_0 \), where \( τ_0 \) is the system reference delay |
| Σ | UDS / UCC | Symbolic or spatial polarity | radians or degrees | Orientation vector of field or structural alignment |
| μ | UDS / UCC | Memory persistence | dimensionless | Fractional persistence or retention coefficient \( μ = e^{-t/τ_d} \) |
| γ | UDS / UCC | Coupling coefficient | variable (s⁻² or dimensionless) | Strength of interaction between τ-field and external energy gradients |
| ⊙ | UDS | Collapse event | — | Transition point marking closure of recursive or energetic state |
| ⊕ | UCC | Continuity operator | — | Represents integrated continuity across delay domains |
| ∇τ | UDS / UCC | Gradient of delay | s·m⁻¹ | Field derivative; measures curvature or local delay change |
| ∇²τ | UCC | Laplacian of delay field | s·m⁻² | Describes total curvature or flux density of delay |
| ρ | UCC | Mass or energy density | kg·m⁻³ | Links τ curvature to gravitational and thermal coupling |
| T | UCC | Temperature field | K | Source of thermodynamic curvature through ∇²T |

---

## 3 · Dimensional Consistency  

UDS operates across many scales; UCC expresses those same dynamics in the formal metric field.  
The normalization term \( θ = τ / τ_0 \) ensures that all UDS parameters remain **scale-independent**.  

Example conversion between frameworks:  
$$
E = hν \quad \Longrightarrow \quad E = k_τ \cdot \frac{1}{τ}
$$
where \( k_τ \) functions analogously to \( h \) but in delay curvature units.  
Thus, a photon’s oscillation frequency (UDS) becomes a curvature inversion term (UCC).

---

## 4 · Functional Equivalence  

| Function | UDS Expression | UCC Expression | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Energy exchange | \( ΔE = hν \) | \( ΔE = k_τ / τ \) | Energy inversely proportional to local delay |
| Field propagation | \( ∇τ = ∂τ/∂x \) | \( ∇τ = g^{-1}(x) ∂τ/∂x \) | Spatial gradient tied to curvature metric |
| Coupling law | \( γ = f(Σ,τ) \) | \( γ = α_Σ Σ∇Σ + α_τ τ∇τ \) | Local polarity and curvature mediate field strength |
| Equilibrium | \( ∇·(E τ μ) = 0 \) | \( ∇_μ(E τ μ) = 0 \) | Conservation of delay-energy continuity |
| Collapse | \( ⊙: (Σ,τ)→Δμ≥0 \) | same | Collapse stores energy as memory rather than loss |

---

## 5 · Example Mapping (Applied)

| Domain | UDS Description | UCC Equivalent |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Quantum | τ ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ s (photon period) | Local curvature in light propagation metric |
| Cellular | τ ≈ 10⁻⁶–10⁻³ s (reaction loops) | Biological continuity curvature |
| Human neural | τ ≈ 0.25–0.6 s | Macroscopic awareness curvature |
| Planetary | τ ≈ 10⁵–10⁹ s | Planetary-scale feedback delay field |
| Cosmological | τ ≈ 10⁹–10¹³ s | Universal curvature of expansion field |

Each scale maintains invariant \(E τ μ = constant\) through dimensional normalization.

---

## 6 · Summary  

> UDS expresses **how delay behaves**; UCC expresses **why** it behaves that way within a continuous field.  
> Mapping UDS into UCC ensures that each observable delay, from photon oscillation to planetary precession, can be measured and modeled within a single unified physical law.
