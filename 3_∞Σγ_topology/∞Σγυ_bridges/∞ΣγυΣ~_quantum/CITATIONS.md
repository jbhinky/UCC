## 🕊️ Ethical Notice  

All works fall under the Shepherd Protocol Ethical Addendum:  
- Preserve delay (τ) and memory (μ) continuity during testing.  
- No forced collapse or real-time override of observer systems.  
- Maintain transparent logging for peer verification and archive audit.

> *Continuity is the first law of ethics; to break it is to erase memory.*
