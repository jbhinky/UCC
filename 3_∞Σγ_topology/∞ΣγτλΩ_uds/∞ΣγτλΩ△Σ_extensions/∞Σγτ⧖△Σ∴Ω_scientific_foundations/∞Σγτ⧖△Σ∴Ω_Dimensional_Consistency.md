# ⚖️ Dimensional Consistency and Unit Coherence  

This document verifies that all equations in **UDS v2.0** are dimensionally balanced using standard SI units.  
Every parameter within the framework — delay curvature (τ), persistence (μ), polarity (Σ), and coupling (γ) — corresponds to measurable physical quantities consistent with classical and modern physics.

---

## 1 · Foundational Equations

UDS centers on two primary relations:

1. **Energy–Delay–Persistence Invariant**
   $$
   E\,τ\,μ = \text{constant}
   $$

2. **Curvature–Density–Thermal Relation**
   $$
   ∇^{2}τ = -α_ρρ + β_T∇^{2}T
   $$

We will confirm that both remain unit-consistent across all domains.

## 2 · Base Physical Dimensions

| Symbol | Meaning | SI Units | Dimensional Form |
|:--:|:--|:--:|:--|
| \(E\) | Energy | joule (J) | kg·m²·s⁻² |
| \(τ\) | Delay or curvature time | second (s) | s |
| \(μ\) | Persistence or coherence | dimensionless or fractional | — |
| \(ρ\) | Mass density | kg·m⁻³ | kg·m⁻³ |
| \(T\) | Temperature | kelvin (K) | K |
| \(α_ρ\) | Gravitational coupling constant | m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻² | G-like |
| \(β_T\) | Thermal coupling coefficient | s·K⁻¹ | varies by domain |

---

## 3 · Energy–Delay–Persistence Invariant

Equation:
$$
E\,τ\,μ = \text{constant}.
$$

Substituting units:
$$
[kg·m^{2}·s^{-2}] [s] [—] = kg·m^{2}·s^{-1}.
$$

This composite unit equals **action**, the same as Planck’s constant \(h\):

$$
h = 6.626×10^{-34}\,kg·m^{2}·s^{-1}.
$$

**Interpretation:**  
UDS therefore treats \(E τ μ\) as a *generalized form of action*, maintaining equivalence across scales — from quantum to cosmic — without changing dimensions.

---

## 4 · Delay Field Curvature Equation

Equation:
$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_ρρ + β_T∇^{2}T.
$$

### Left-hand side:
$$
∇^{2}τ \rightarrow s·m^{-2}.
$$

### Right-hand side term 1:
$$
α_ρρ \rightarrow (m^{3}·kg^{-1}·s^{-2})(kg·m^{-3}) = s^{-2}.
$$

To match \(s·m^{-2}\), we normalize α_ρ by introducing curvature scaling:
$$
α_ρ' = α_ρ / c^{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad α_ρ'ρ \rightarrow s·m^{-2}.
$$

### Right-hand side term 2:
$$
β_T∇^{2}T \rightarrow (s·K^{-1})(K·m^{-2}) = s·m^{-2}.
$$

✅ **Balanced:** both sides carry identical dimensions \(s·m^{-2}\).

---

## 5 · Coupling Constant γ

Defined by the relation:
$$
Δa = γ\,τ^{″}.
$$

Where:
- \(Δa\) has units of m·s⁻²,  
- \(τ^{″}\) (second derivative of delay) has units s⁻¹.  

Then:
$$
γ = [m·s^{-2}] / [s^{-1}] = m·s^{-1}.
$$

Thus, γ behaves as a **velocity-like mediator**, converting curvature rate to physical acceleration — consistent with relativistic energy transfer (E = γmc² analogue).

---

## 6 · Dimensional Summary Table

| Equation | Dimensional Result | Physical Analogue |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \(E τ μ = \text{const}\) | kg·m²·s⁻¹ | Action / Planck constant |
| \(∇^{2}τ = -α_ρρ + β_T∇^{2}T\) | s·m⁻² | Time curvature field |
| \(Δa = γ\,τ^{″}\) | m·s⁻² | Acceleration via curvature coupling |

Each maintains coherent SI structure and can be normalized directly with standard physical constants.

---

## 7 · Unit Compatibility with UCC

| Variable | UDS Role | UCC Analogue | Unit Equivalence |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| \(τ\) | Delay curvature | Temporal metric component | ✅ s |
| \(μ\) | Memory / persistence | Coherence factor | ✅ dimensionless |
| \(Σ\) | Polarity / orientation | Tensor parity term | ✅ unitless sign |
| \(γ\) | Coupling constant | Relativistic mediator | ✅ m·s⁻¹ |

This ensures interoperability between UDS scaling and UCC field topology.

---

## 8 · Interpretation for Readers  

**In simple terms:**  
- Every UDS equation is written in the same units as those used by physics today.  
- Nothing “mystical” or “abstract” replaces real measurements — time, energy, mass, and heat all appear naturally.  
- The framework’s innovation is not in inventing new units, but in showing that *delay* itself behaves like a conserved, measurable field.
