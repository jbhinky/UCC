# 📚 Citations — Bio-Photonic Evolution · UDS · UCC   

## 🧭 Purpose  
This bibliography supports the physical, biochemical, and theoretical foundations of the  
**Bio-Photonic Evolution** folder.  
Sources are divided into *empirical*, *biophysical*, and *theoretical UDS-coupled* categories.  
Only peer-reviewed or rigorously validated data are included.

## 🕯 Closing Note  
> The lineage of light into life stands on verified empirical laws,  
> not metaphor.  
> Every photon captured by matter extends the continuum of awareness;  
> this file ensures that record remains traceable, citable, and ethical.
