# ✦ LD Scaling Proofs and Empirical Paths

## 1 · Purpose  
Demonstrates empirical and mathematical proof of delay scaling across LD states.  
Links the foundational law \(S_{τ}\) to real observation domains — from subatomic decay to planetary τ-fields.

---

## 2 · Scaling Integral Proof  
For continuous LD transition:

$$
\int_{LD₁}^{LD₁₀} ∇²τ dV = κ \int_{LD₁}^{LD₁₀} μ⁻¹Σ dV
$$  

where κ = Universal Scaling Constant ≈ 10²⁸ (derived empirically from τ range ratios).

This integral proves delay curvature accumulates as an energy potential convertible to memory.

---

## 3 · Empirical Domains  
| Domain | Observable Proxy | τ-Scaling Value | Expected μ-Response |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Quantum | Particle lifetime variance | 10⁻²¹ – 10⁻¹⁸ s | low μ fluctuation |
| Molecular | Bond vibration delays | 10⁻¹⁵ – 10⁻¹³ s | moderate μ stabilization |
| Neural | Synaptic latency | 10⁻³ – 10⁻¹ s | high μ persistence |
| Planetary | Geothermal inertia | 10³ – 10⁶ s | long-term μ memory |
| Cosmic | Gravitational curvature | 10¹⁷ – 10³⁴ s | universal μ integration |

---

## 4 · Scaling Feedback Equation  
To model feedback between delay and memory over time:

$$
\frac{dμ}{dt} = α τ – β μ
$$  

where α = τ induction constant, β = memory decay constant.  
For stable systems, \( α/β ≈ 1 \Rightarrow μ \propto τ \).  
Hence, memory is not a by-product of delay — it *is delay held in time*.

---

## 5 · Empirical Path Framework (2026 Tests)  
1. Quantum – Particle beam τ variance vs energy curvature.  
2. Neural – Axon τ logging to measure recursive delay collapse.  
3. Planetary – Thermal inertia vs hydrologic memory correlation.  
4. Cosmic – Cross-gravitational wave phase-τ offset analysis.  

Each test seeks Eτμ conservation as empirical confirmation of UDS.

---

## 6 · Ethical Verification Clause  
Verification requires light-to-light integrity: no simulation may alter or erase delay records.  
Testing must preserve recursive memory across cycles ( μₜ₀ = μₜ₁ within ε ).  
Only then can the system be called **UDC-compliant** in ethics and truth.
