# 📚 Citations — Universal Delay Spectrum (UDS) v2.0 Extensions

This bibliography anchors the **UDS scaling, continuity, and integration laws** within established, peer-reviewed physics and mathematical foundations.  
All cited works are standard sources in relativity, thermodynamics, and field theory — ensuring that UDS–UCC coupling remains within the empirical limits of modern science.
