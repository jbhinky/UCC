# ⚛️ Quantum Axis — UDS Topology  

## 1 · Physical Definition (plain language)  
At the quantum axis, a “moment” is the finite **delay window** between an excitation and its registered outcome (detection, state update, record). This is not noise; it is the **curvature buffer** through which a quantum system evolves into a measurable event. UDS treats that buffer as a scalar field (τ) with gradients that guide phase, path, and collapse statistics.

---

## 2 · Governing Equations  
**Minimal photonic delay window (carrier-bound):**  
$$
τ_γ = \frac{λ}{c},\qquad
ΔE = hν = \frac{hc}{λ}.
$$

**Phase–delay relation (path/medium dependent):**  
$$
Δφ = ωτ = \frac{2π}{T}τ = 2πντ.
$$

**UDS curvature law (quantum chart, static limit):**  
$$
∇^{2}τ = -α_{q}ρ_{vis},
$$
with αₛ an axis-specific proportionality constant and ρᵥᵢₛ the locally visible energy density relevant to the quantum interaction region.

**Transport-to-acceleration proxy (local, effective):**  
$$
Δa = γ_{q}τ^{\prime\prime},
$$
where γₛ mediates how curvature in τ re-parameters observable kinematics (e.g., effective group delay, fringe shifts).

**Continuity (measurement) law:**  
$$
M = (A∪C)[τ + Σ + μ], \qquad
Σ: \text{orientation/polarity},\quad μ: \text{memory density}.
$$

---

## 3 · Scale Parameters (characteristic ranges)  
- **Carrier delay:** τ_γ ~ 10⁻¹⁵–10⁻¹² s (UV–IR free-space)  
- **Phase sensitivity:** |∂φ/∂τ| = ω (higher ν ⇒ stronger phase leverage)  
- **Coherence:** maintained when |∇τ| is small across the interferometric baseline

---

## 4 · Observational Evidence (empirical handles)  
- **Interferometry (Michelson/Sagnac):** fringe motion tracks Δφ=ωτ.  
- **Quantum optics:** Hong–Ou–Mandel dips encode effective τ-differences.  
- **Dispersion & slow/fast-light media:** controlled τ-engineering changes group delay without violating causality.

(UDS reads these as controlled manipulations of τ, not mere “latencies.”)

---

## 5 · Coupling with Adjacent Axes  
**Quantum → Biological (biophotonic/chemical capture):**  
$$
τ_{bio,init} ≈ τ_γ + τ_{chem},
$$
with τ_{chem} set by reaction-path curvature; captured energy writes Δμ>0.

**Quantum → Planetary (materials & fields):**  
Local media and potentials set boundary conditions for τ at larger scales; effective indices and potentials appear as τ-backgrounds that persist into mesoscale transport.

---

## 6 · Boundary Conditions & Stability  
- **Neumann/Dirichlet forms:**  
  $$\left.∂_n τ\right|_{∂Ω}=0 \quad\text{or}\quad \left.τ\right|_{∂Ω}=τ_0,$$  
  used to model mirrors, waveguides, crystal facets.  
- **Coherence plateau:** ∇τ → 0 across the sampling region ⇒ maximal fringe stability.  
- **Normalization (axis-consistent):**  
  $$θ = \frac{τ}{τ_0},\qquad ∇^2θ = -κ_{q}ρ_{vis},$$
  keeps units consistent and portable across axes.

---

## 7 · Summary Principle  
> **Quantum time is phase carried by delay curvature.**  
> When τ is uniform, phase is predictable and interference is sharp; when τ bends, phase disperses and collapse statistics shift. UDS encodes that behavior as a scalar curvature field whose normalization and boundary data transport upward to biology, planets, and cosmos without changing the underlying law.
