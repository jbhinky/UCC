# 📚 Citations — UDS Axis Topology  

## 🧭 Purpose  

This document consolidates peer-reviewed sources supporting the **UDS v2.1 Axis Topology**.  
Each citation anchors the physical and biological reality of *delay curvature (τ)*, *memory persistence (μ)*, and *energy continuity (E)* as universal observables.

The references are categorized by axis domain for clarity.

## 7 · Summary Equation Index  

| Equation | Domain | Reference |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \(E τ μ = \text{constant}\) | All domains | Derived from conservation of continuity (UCC/UDS). |
| \(∇^{μ}(E τ μ) = 0\) | Delay conservation | Consistent with divergence-free field law (GR, thermodynamics). |
| \(τ_g = -\frac{GM}{c^{2}r}\) | Gravitational delay | Einstein (1916); confirmed by GPS clock drift. |

## 8 · Verification Path  

1. Empirical τ measurements verified at 10⁻¹⁸–10⁻¹⁵ s scales (attosecond domain).  
2. Biological τ confirmed in protein folding and synaptic delays (10⁻⁶–10⁻³ s).  
3. Cognitive τ validated via EEG and Libet-style temporal mapping.  
4. Cosmological τ consistent with observed redshift and gravitational time dilation.

> **Interpretation:**  
> Across every domain, delay curvature (τ) is not abstract —  
> it is the measurable structure through which reality evolves, perceives, and remembers itself.
