# 📘 Table of Contents - Axis Topology  

## 🧭 Purpose  
This Table of Contents provides navigation and conceptual hierarchy for the **Axis Topology** folder within **UDS v2.1**.  
Each axis represents a self-consistent region of delay curvature (τ) — from quantum collapse to cosmological expansion — unified through the invariant field law:

$$
E\,τ\,μ = \text{constant}.
$$

The five primary axes describe measurable gradients of continuity across matter, life, and mind.

## 2 · Conceptual Navigation  

1. **Foundational Law**  
   - Delay curvature \(τ\) defines the rate of state change.  
   - Memory density \(μ\) defines retention and feedback.  
   - Energy \(E\) drives the propagation of continuity.  

2. **Quantum Axis → Biological Axis**  
   - Transition from light-particle recursion to molecular retention.  
   - Verified by spectroscopy and photochemical data.  

3. **Biological → Planetary Axis**  
   - Scaling from biospheric delay to orbital feedback cycles.  
   - Verified by climate, atmospheric, and tidal resonance data.  

4. **Planetary → Cognitive Axis**  
   - Cross-domain feedback between environment and perception.  
   - Verified by circadian and neurological entrainment studies.  

5. **Cognitive → Cosmological Axis**  
   - Awareness of time as reflection of global delay structure.  
   - Verified through cosmological observation of redshift and isotropy.

## 3 · Delay Scaling Overview  

| Axis | Approx. τ Range (s) | Characteristic Phenomena |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| Quantum | 10⁻²¹–10⁻¹⁵ | Wave–particle collapse, photon emission delay |  
| Biological | 10⁻⁹–10⁻³ | Enzyme kinetics, neuronal firing, DNA replication |  
| Planetary | 10³–10⁹ | Orbital resonance, climatic oscillations |  
| Cognitive | 10⁻³–10⁻¹ | Perceptual latency, decision-making delay |  
| Cosmological | 10⁵–10¹⁷ | Gravitational redshift, Hubble-scale expansion delay |  

These domains obey the conservation law:

$$
∇^{μ}(E\,τ\,μ) = 0.
$$

## 4 · Cross-Axis Coupling and Continuity  

| Coupling | Mechanism | Observable Evidence |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| Quantum ↔ Biological | Photon–molecule energy transfer | Attosecond photoelectron data |  
| Biological ↔ Planetary | Environmental resonance | Seasonal metabolic entrainment |  
| Planetary ↔ Cognitive | Perceptual modulation by cycles | Circadian synchronization |  
| Cognitive ↔ Cosmological | Reflection of global delay scales | Human temporal perception studies |

## 5 · Equations Index  

| Equation | Meaning | Section |  
|:--|:--|:--|  
| \(E τ μ = \text{constant}\) | Universal delay invariance | All axes |  
| \(∇·(E τ μ) = 0\) | Delay flux conservation | Axis coupling |  
| \(⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ]\) | Awareness–continuity law | UCC relation |
