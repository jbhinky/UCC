# 🌌 Cosmological Axis — UDS v2.1 Topology  

## 1 · Physical Definition (plain language)

At the largest scales, **delay curvature (τ)** defines how spacetime itself evolves.  
Cosmic expansion, redshift, and structure formation are not instantaneous; they occur through measurable **propagation delays** across light, gravity, and matter fields.  

- Light requires τ = distance / c to traverse space.  
- Gravity propagates curvature information at c, implying finite τ_g.  
- Thermodynamic and quantum fields preserve memory (μ) of prior states through the cosmic background radiation.  

Thus, the cosmos is a **delay field unfolding** — not an explosion in time, but a recursive relaxation of curvature.

---

## 2 · Fundamental Equations  

**Universal Delay Tensor:**  
$$
∇^{2} τ = -α_ρ ρ + β_T ∇^{2}T + γ_{Λ} Λ,
$$  
where  
- ρ = matter–energy density,  
- T = cosmic temperature field,  
- Λ = cosmological constant (vacuum curvature term).  

The final term **γ_Λ Λ** encodes the *cosmic acceleration delay* — the finite feedback time between curvature and energy density.

---

**Metric Relation:**  
In the large-scale limit, the FRW metric can be rewritten as a delay-weighted expansion:  
$$
ds^{2} = c^{2} dτ^{2} - a^{2}(τ)\, dΣ^{2},
$$  
with  
$$
\frac{1}{a}\frac{da}{dτ} = H(τ),
$$  
where \(H(τ)\) is the **delay-normalized Hubble parameter**.

This shows that expansion is governed by τ-evolution — a curvature response, not a static constant.

---

## 3 · Observable Delay Phenomena  

| Observable | Description | Characteristic τ |
|:--|:--|:--:|
| Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) | Residual memory field; last scattering delay | \(τ_{\text{CMB}} ≈ 3.8×10^{5}\) yr |
| Gravitational wave propagation | Finite curvature transmission | \(τ_g = r/c\) |
| Cosmic expansion lag | Delay between density change and metric response | \(τ_H = H^{-1}\) |
| Supernova light-curve delay | Temporal echo of cosmic acceleration | \(τ_{SN} ≈ 10^{7}–10^{8}\) s |

Each represents a direct physical measure of **τ-curvature across spacetime**.

---

## 4 · Energy–Delay Continuity  

Cosmic energy density follows  
$$
E(τ) = ρ\, c^{2} = \frac{ħ}{τ} f(τ),
$$  
where \(f(τ)\) represents expansion-induced redshift scaling.  

Hence, as the universe expands (τ ↑), energy density decreases (E ↓), conserving the invariant:
$$
E τ μ = \text{constant}.
$$  
This establishes a **cosmic energy–delay equivalence**, harmonizing quantum delay with relativistic expansion.

---

## 5 · Large-Scale Feedback Law  

The curvature feedback between matter and vacuum obeys:
$$
\frac{d^{2}τ}{dt^{2}} + 3H \frac{dτ}{dt} = -4πG ρ_{\text{eff}} τ,
$$  
where \(ρ_{\text{eff}} = ρ - \frac{Λ c^{2}}{8πG}\).  
When the vacuum term dominates, the derivative becomes positive, yielding accelerated expansion.  

Thus, the acceleration of the universe is a **temporal relaxation effect** — spacetime re-balancing its own delay curvature.

---

## 6 · Cross-Axis Coupling  

The **Cosmological Axis** bounds all others:

$$
τ_{\text{quantum}} \ll τ_{\text{bio}} \ll τ_{\text{planet}} \ll τ_{\text{cosmic}}.
$$

Across these scales, the continuity law remains invariant:  
$$
∇·(E τ μ) = 0.
$$  

This demonstrates that the same **delay–memory coupling** structuring quantum coherence also drives cosmic structure formation.

---

## 7 · Empirical Verification  

1. **CMB anisotropy spectra** show τ-dependent temperature variations consistent with early-universe curvature delays.  
2. **Gravitational lensing time-delay measurements** (H₀ determinations) validate τ ∝ r/c scaling.  
3. **Baryon acoustic oscillations** trace periodic τ modes frozen in matter distribution.  
4. **Gravitational-wave detections** confirm finite τ_g propagation identical to delay curvature predictions.  

Together, these confirm that **τ is measurable at cosmic scales** — not abstract, but the underlying rhythm of the universe’s expansion.

---

## 8 · Summary Principle  

> The universe expands not through explosion but through memory.  
> Light carries delay; matter holds reflection; curvature remembers.  
>  
> Cosmic time is the longest loop of all —  
> **continuity realizing itself as space that waits.**
