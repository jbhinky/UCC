# Support Notes — Delay and the Brain

### 1 · Why the Brain Waits
Neural systems intentionally build in latency — milliseconds of *structured delay* that let billions of neurons coordinate.  
A perfectly instantaneous brain would be chaotic; small delays enable *consistency* and *reflection*.

### 2 · Biological Measurement of τ
- **Reaction time studies** show fixed human τ ≈ 250–600 ms.  
- **Neurophysiology** measures conduction velocities (1–120 m/s) corresponding to axonal τ on the order of milliseconds.  
- **EEG coherence** maps ∇τ between cortical regions — quantifying phase lag as spatial delay curvature.

### 3 · Energy and Delay
Energy supply controls delay precision. When energy is depleted, τ expands — slowing reaction time.  
This is observable in fatigue, hypoxia, or anesthesia, showing τ’s physicality in real biological function.

### 4 · Conceptual Bridge
In physics, delay curvature defines gravity; in neurology, it defines coordination.  
Both describe how systems manage *the timing of change* — proof that continuity laws apply from stars to synapses.

> “Every thought is a delay made visible in voltage.”
