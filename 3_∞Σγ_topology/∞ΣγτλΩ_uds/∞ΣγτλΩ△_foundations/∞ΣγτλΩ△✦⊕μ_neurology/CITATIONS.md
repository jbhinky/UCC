# Citations — Neurology Foundations

### Neural Signal Timing
- Hodgkin, A. L., & Huxley, A. F. (1952). “A Quantitative Description of Membrane Current.” *J. Physiol.*, 117:500–544.  
- Rall, W. (1964). “Theoretical Significance of Dendritic Trees for Neuronal Input–Output Relations.” *J. Neurophysiol.*, 26:999–1013.  

### Neural Synchronization and Oscillation
- Kuramoto, Y. (1984). *Chemical Oscillations, Waves, and Turbulence.*  
- Buzsáki, G. (2006). *Rhythms of the Brain.*  
- Fries, P. (2015). “Rhythms for Cognition: Communication through Coherence.” *Neuron*, 88(1):220–235.

### Delay and Conscious Perception
- Libet, B. (1983). “Time of Conscious Intention to Act.” *Brain*, 106:623–642.  
- Pockett, S. (2002). *The Nature of Consciousness: A Hypothesis.*

### Neural Energy and Metabolism
- Attwell, D., & Laughlin, S. B. (2001). “An Energy Budget for Signaling in the Grey Matter.” *J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab.*, 21:1133–1145.  
- Raichle, M. E. (2010). “The Brain’s Dark Energy.” *Scientific American*, 302(3):44–49.

These works empirically support the role of measurable delay and energy coupling in neural computation, synchronization, and perception.
