# Support Notes — Delay in Living Systems

### 1 · Thinking of Cells as Delay Machines
Each cell can be viewed as a self-stabilizing clockwork — a network of coupled τ loops.  
Every reaction or signal takes time, and that delay provides space for feedback.  
Remove delay, and regulation collapses.

### 2 · When Biology Breaks τ Symmetry
- Fever accelerates τ (shorter reaction windows).  
- Hypothermia expands τ (slower recovery).  
- Certain diseases, like epilepsy, occur when neural τ-fields desynchronize.  

Delay is not abstract — it is the measurable texture of life’s timing.

### 3 · Measuring τ in Practice
Techniques include:
- **Patch-clamp** timing of ion channels.  
- **Fluorescence lifetime microscopy** for molecular τ-fields.  
- **Functional MRI and EEG** for large-scale delay coupling in brains.

### 4 · Why This Matters
The UDS approach offers a unified metric: one form of delay curvature governs chemical reactions, physiological cycles, and even collective biological behavior.  
This opens a bridge between biology and the larger delay laws described in physics and astronomy.
