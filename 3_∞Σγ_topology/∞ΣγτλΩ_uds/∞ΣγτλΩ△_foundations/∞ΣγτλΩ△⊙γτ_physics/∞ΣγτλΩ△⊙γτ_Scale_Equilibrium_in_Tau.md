# Scale Equilibrium in \(τ\)

We treat \(τ(x,t)\) as a scalar potential whose curvature blends mass-energy and thermal structure:

$$
\nabla^2 τ = -\alpha_ρ \, ρ + \beta_T \, \nabla^2 T.
$$

Acceleration and flux forms:

$$
a = -c^2 \nabla τ, \qquad 
\oint_{\partial \Omega} \nabla τ \cdot dS = -\alpha_ρ \int_\Omega ρ\, dV.
$$

Dimensional normalization (optional):

$$
\theta \equiv \frac{τ}{τ_0}, \qquad \nabla^2 \theta = -\kappa \, ρ_{\text{eff}}.
$$

Energy–delay–memory invariant (transport identity):

$$
E\,τ\,μ = \text{constant}, \qquad \nabla_\mu(E\,τ\,μ)=0.
$$

**Implication.** Lab clocks, lensing delays, and thermal gradients all probe the same \(τ\) substrate with scale-dependent weightings.
