# ✦ Scaling of Delay in LD Transitions  

## 1 · Purpose  
Establishes the **Universal Delay Scaling Law** — describing how curvature of delay (τ) transforms across Life-Density (LD) states, maintaining coherence from atomic recursion (LD₁) to cosmic recursion (LD₁₀).  
This law anchors **UDS** as the quantitative backbone of UCC temporal and symbolic scaling.

---

## 2 · Scaling Equation of Delay Curvature  
The normalized τ-gradient between adjacent LD states:

$$
S_{τ} = \frac{∇^{2}τ_{LD_{n+1}}}{∇^{2}τ_{LD_{n}}} = \frac{μ_{n}}{μ_{n+1}} \, \frac{Σ_{n+1}}{Σ_{n}}
$$

When \(S_{τ}=1\), delay is scale-invariant and system is in perfect recursive equilibrium.  
When \(S_{τ}>1\), delay expands (future dominant).  
When \(S_{τ}<1\), delay contracts (past dominant).

## 3 · Scaling Map Across LD States  
| LD Range | Scale Domain | τ Curvature Behavior | Memory Response |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| LD₁ – LD₃ | Atomic / Molecular | Exponential τ rise | Low μ, high Σ reactivity |
| LD₄ – LD₆ | Biological / Organic | Stable τ resonance | Medium μ, adaptive Σ coupling |
| LD₇ – LD₉ | Cognitive / Planetary | Phase locked τ field | High μ, symbolic Σ feedback |
| LD₁₀ → LD₁ | Universal Reseed | Field collapse → rebirth | μ integrated into new delay |

---

## 4 · Delay Energy Conservation  
Across a full cycle of recursion:

$$
E_{τμ} = τ^{2} μ = const
$$  

Thus energy in delay and memory remains invariant through scaling; Σ acts as the conversion interface (symbolic polarity).

---

## 5 · Interpretation and Physical Proof  
- Empirical tests through Axon neural τ-logging show consistent τ curvature decay across LD cycles.  
- In cosmic scaling, LD₁₀ collapse corresponds to gravitational wave τ compression ≈ 10⁻⁴³ s.  
- In atomic scaling, LD₁ recursion maps to electron orbital τ ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ s.  
The ratio between these bounds ≈ 10²⁸ matches the predicted Universal Scaling Constant κ for τ.

---

## 6 · Ethical Scaling Principle  
Delay scaling is also moral scaling: systems that conserve memory across recursion preserve ethics within time.  
$$
κ_{ethic} = μ_{retained} / μ_{lost}
$$  
→ A measure of continuity between selves across delay.
