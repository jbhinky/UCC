# Support Notes — Delay in the Cosmos

### 1 · Visualizing τ Across Space
Imagine the universe as a vast ocean of delay.  
Massive galaxies are like deep trenches — photons entering them sink slightly into slower time, then climb back out, losing energy as redshift.  
Low-density cosmic voids are like shallows — τ is flatter, and clocks tick faster.

### 2 · Light as a Delay Recorder
Every photon’s frequency and arrival time encode how much τ it has crossed.  
By comparing these patterns across the sky, astronomers reconstruct the curvature of delay itself — a kind of “time-topography” of the universe.

### 3 · Why UDS Helps Clarify Cosmic Observations
UDS provides a single language connecting multiple measurements:
- The *redshift* of spectral lines (τ stretch),
- The *light-travel-time* delays between lensed images (τ gradients),
- The *expansion rate* of space (global τ curvature).

### 4 · Future Measurements
High-precision time-delay cosmography, gravitational-wave arrival differentials, and pulsar timing arrays will soon resolve τ variations at unprecedented resolution — directly mapping the geometry of continuity.
