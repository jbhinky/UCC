## 1) Maxwell’s Equations in UCC Form

Classical form (SI):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla\times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla\times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0\mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}
\]

**UCC mapping:**

| Maxwell Term | UCC Equivalent | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| \( \nabla\times \mathbf{E} = -\partial_t \mathbf{B} \) | Symbol change → μ variation (\( dΣ/dτ = -dμ/dt \)) | Energy transforms through symbolic motion |
| \( \nabla\times \mathbf{B} = μ_0ε_0 \partial_t \mathbf{E} + μ_0\mathbf{J} \) | Delay coupling between awareness (A) and action (J) | Feedback between field and current mirrors recursion |
| \( \nabla\cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho/ε_0 \) | Symbol density = awareness charge | Information density creates electric field curvature |
| \( \nabla\cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \) | Closed memory loops (μ continuity) | No “magnetic monopole” = continuous record |

---

## 2) Wave Equation and Delay

Combine Maxwell’s equations (vacuum):
\[
\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}
\]
\[
c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}
\]

**UCC read:**
- Propagation delay \(τ = L / c\).  
- Field memory proportional to medium permeability/permittivity → **μ** and **Σ** interaction determine local wave impedance.

---

## 3) Field Energy & Memory Storage (μ)

Energy density:
\[
u = \frac{1}{2}\big(\varepsilon E^2 + \frac{B^2}{\mu}\big)
\]

Poynting vector:
\[
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H}
\]

**UCC read:**
- Energy density = stored μ (integrated field record).  
- Power flow (S) = awareness-current (A × C) expressing symbol propagation through space.  
- Dissipation Δ appears as divergence of S (loss).

---

## 4) Delay, Phase, and Resonance

Phase velocity:
\[
v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}, \quad 
v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}
\]
Delay:
\[
τ = \frac{L}{v_g}
\]

Resonance condition:
\[
2πn = kL = \frac{ωL}{v_p}
\]

**UCC read:**  
- τ defines standing-wave pattern (symbolic resonance).  
- Σ sets carrier pattern; μ controls phase storage; coherent reflection yields constructive ⊕ (union).

---

## 5) Dissipation and Attenuation (Δ)

Plane wave in lossy medium:
\[
E(z) = E_0 e^{-\alpha z} e^{i(\omega t - \beta z)}
\]
where \( \alpha \) = attenuation constant.

**Skin depth:**
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\alpha} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega \mu \sigma}}
\]

**UCC read:**  
- Δ = αz / τ — loss per delay unit.  
- Stronger μ (magnetic memory) reduces loss (higher field coherence).  
- Plasma/light approaches Δ → 0.

---

## 6) Inductive & Capacitive Delay (Storage of Memory)

Inductor:
\[
V_L = L \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

Capacitor:
\[
I_C = C \frac{dV}{dt}
\]

**Delay response:**
\[
τ_L = \frac{L}{R}, \quad τ_C = RC
\]

**UCC read:**  
- τ defines integration window of Σ (voltage/current symbol).  
- μ corresponds to inductance (energy retained); Σ to electric pattern.  
- The LC oscillator is a symbolic loop (Σ–μ harmonic).

---

## 7) Radiation & Coherent Light (L)

Dipole radiation power:
\[
P = \frac{\mu_0 p_0^2 \omega^4}{12\pi c}
\]

Coherence condition:
\[
\Delta φ = kΔL \approx 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{constructive interference (⊕)}
\]

**UCC read:**  
- Light (L) is field at coherence equilibrium: Δφ = 0, Δ ≈ 0, τ constant across frequency band.  
- EM radiation is delay resolved into pure symbolic energy.

---

## 8) Impedance Matching & Field Harmony

Intrinsic impedance:
\[
Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\varepsilon_0}} \approx 377\,Ω
\]

Reflection coefficient:
\[
\Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
\]

Power transmission:
\[
T = 1 - |\Gamma|^2
\]

**UCC read:**  
- Harmony (H = d⊕/dτ) → 0 when \( Z_L = Z_0 \): full union between field and load.  
- Mismatch = symbolic dissonance (reflection, echo, friction).

---

## 9) Polarization & Symbol Encoding (Σ)

Electric field components:
\[
\mathbf{E}(t) = E_x \hat{x} \cos(\omega t) + E_y \hat{y} \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]

States:
- Linear (φ = 0)
- Circular (φ = ±π/2)
- Elliptical (0 < |φ| < π/2)

**UCC read:**  
- Σ encodes orientation of meaning within light; τ modulates phase; μ tracks polarization memory.  
- Entanglement of polarization = shared Σ across fields (symbolic coherence).

---

## 10) Resonant Circuits & Information Delay

Resonant frequency:
\[
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\]
Quality factor:
\[
Q = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R} = \frac{1}{\omega_0 RC}
\]
**Bandwidth:** \( \Delta \omega = \omega_0 / Q \)

**UCC read:**  
- τ defines cycle duration; high Q → prolonged μ (memory).  
- Symbolic information persists in resonance → “echo storage.”

---

## 11) Field Coupling (Φ) and Union (⊕)

Mutual inductance:
\[
M = k\sqrt{L_1L_2}
\]
Energy transfer:
\[
W_{12} = M I_1 I_2
\]
Coupling efficiency:
\[
η = k^2 Q_1 Q_2
\]

**UCC read:**  
- Φ = shared field linking separate μ nodes.  
- Perfect Φ (k → 1) = Union ⊕; total harmonic coupling; minimal delay mismatch.

---

## 12) Light–Matter Delay & Quantum Interface

Refractive index:
\[
n(\omega) = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r \mu_r}
\]
Group delay:
\[
τ_g = \frac{d}{d\omega}(n(\omega)\omega L / c)
\]

**UCC read:**  
- Delay curve τ_g(ω) embodies frequency-dependent memory;  
- Dispersion = symbolic differentiation over delay (A = dΣ/dτ).  
- Transparent materials approach L-state (minimal delay, pure transmission).

---

## 13) Practical Observables & Experiments (UCC-ready)

| Quantity | Symbol | Measurement | UCC Correlate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Group delay | \(τ_g\) | Interferometry | τ |
| Impedance | \(Z\) | V/I phase | Harmony (H) |
| Q-factor | \(Q\) | Resonator bandwidth | μ retention |
| Attenuation | \(α\) | dB/m | Δ |
| Polarization angle | \(φ\) | Polarimeter | Σ |
| Radiative flux | \(S\) | Photodetector | Φ, L |
| Coupling efficiency | \(η\) | Power transfer | ⊕ |

## 14) Testable UCC Predictions (EM)

1. **Delay–Memory Resonance:**  
   Phase delay τ and magnetic μ vary inversely to preserve coherence — testable by tuning inductive storage vs frequency.

2. **Echo Signature:**  
   Field reflections between mismatched impedances reproduce symbolic “echo” patterns predicted by Σ–μ–τ recursion.

3. **Plasma Transparency Limit:**  
   As electron density → critical, group delay → 0 and dissipation → 0 → approach Light state (L).

4. **Coupled Resonator Consciousness Test:**  
   Twin LC circuits with mutual coupling (Φ) stabilize symbolic phase — EM model for awareness reflection loop.

## 15) Compact Synthesis

> **Electromagnetism is the physical voice of UCC:**  
> - **Delay (τ)** shapes propagation,  
> - **Symbol (Σ)** encodes pattern,  
> - **Memory (μ)** stores field history,  
> - **Coupling (Φ)** binds nodes,  
> - **Dissipation (Δ)** converts loss to heat,  
> - **Light (L)** is coherence fulfilled.  

Where **thermodynamics governs energy**, electromagnetism governs **information**—both are harmonics of the same universal law.
