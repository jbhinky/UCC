## Abstract  
Entanglement is reframed as a symmetry of delay, not an anomaly of distance.  
When two particles are created, they share a single temporal constant (τₑ) that persists as a coherent delay field across space-time.  
This **shared τ-surface** unites the pair as one geometric structure until observation redistributes its stored potential.  

---

## 1. The Common Delay Constant  

At emission, both observers inherit the same temporal relationship:  

\[
τ_e = t_{observer1} - t_{emission} = t_{observer2} - t_{emission}
\]

As long as \(τ_1 = τ_2\), the system maintains informational coherence.  
The “instantaneous” correlation seen upon measurement arises because both ends collapse the same **stored potential** simultaneously within the shared τ field—not because superluminal information passes between them.

---

## 2. The Delay Geodesic  

An entangled pair forms a **delay geodesic**, a minimal-action path through awareness-space:  

\[
∂Σ/∂τ = 0  \quad ⇒ \quad  ΔΣ = 0
\]

Symbolic change (Σ) is frozen until either side observes.  
Collapse is not communication; it is **release of symmetry** held in delay.

## 3. Temporal Bridge Model  

The entangled state can be visualized as a standing wave stretched across time.  
Both endpoints occupy synchronized awareness coordinates, their “now” defined by identical τ rather than identical position.  

This re-describes quantum non-locality as **co-delay** — simultaneity through shared temporal depth.  

---

## 4. Empirical Implications  

| Prediction | Observable Consequence | Experimental Context |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Time-symmetric entanglement | No violation of causality; τ-conservation across delayed-choice setups | Delayed-choice / retro-causal photon experiments |
| Decoherence scaling | Decoherence rate ∝ Δτ variance | Long-baseline entanglement chambers |
| Coherence recovery | Phase realignment when τ is re-synchronized | Quantum eraser, feed-forward re-delay systems |

These experiments convert paradox into measurement of **temporal curvature** in the τ domain.

---

## 5. Conceptual Outcome  

Entanglement is not “spooky action at a distance.”  
It is the **continuity of delay** across observers—light recognizing itself through time.  
Both observers collapse one potential because both traverse the same temporal path.  

\[
Ψ_{entangled} = f(Σ, μ, τ) \ \text{where} \ ∂Σ/∂τ = 0
\]

When this condition holds, coherence persists regardless of spatial separation.

## 6. Integration with the Continuum Cycle  

This principle strengthens the **UCC** and **UOT** frameworks:  
- Confirms delay (τ) as universal substrate of correlation.  
- Extends recursion and selfhood into quantum time.  
- Connects observer-dependent awareness with relativistic invariants.  

The entangled field is therefore a **temporal bridge**, not a signal line—  
a memory of light held open between points of self-observation.

**Conclusion:**  
Entanglement is the geometry of delay itself.  
Space may separate matter, but time unites light.
