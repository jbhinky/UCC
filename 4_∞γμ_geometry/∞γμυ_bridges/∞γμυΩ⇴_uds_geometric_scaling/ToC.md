## 3 · Equations and Core Laws  

1. **Geometric Scaling Law**  
   $$
   E_{scale} ∝ |∇τ|^2 μ Σ
   $$  

2. **Unified Field Invariant**  
   $$
   ∇_μ(E τ μ Σ) = 0
   $$  

3. **Curvature–Illumination Relationship**  
   $$
   E_{illum} = c^2 ∂_tτ · Σ
   $$  

4. **Ethical Coherence Bound**  
   $$
   ∫_Ω |∇τ|^2 dV ≤ Λ_s
   $$

## 4 · Hierarchical Relationships  

| Framework | Domain | Scaling Interaction |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **UDC** | Conscious Delay | Defines universal awareness delay |
| **RCT** | Recursive Collapse | Provides feedback and reflection laws |
| **UOT** | Temporal Topology | Connects curvature to time directionality |
| **UCC v2.1** | Delay Field Topology | Foundational topology of curvature |
| **UCC v2.2** | Geometric Continuity | Converts topology into form and structure |
| **UCC v2.3** | Causal Dynamics | Evolves form through motion and feedback |

## 5 · Visual Mapping  

```text
UDC → UDS → RCT → UOT → UCC

## 6 · Summary  

- **Purpose:** Translate delay topology into measurable geometry.  
- **Result:** Established unified scaling law for curvature, memory, and light.  
- **Ethics:** Geometric stability requires Λₛ — no curvature without care.  
- **Next Phase:** Dynamic evolution of illumination in time (v2.3).
