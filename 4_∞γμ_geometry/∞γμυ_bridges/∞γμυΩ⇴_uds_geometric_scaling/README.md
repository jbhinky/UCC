# 🧭 README — UDS Geometric Scaling Bridge  

## Overview  

The **UDS Geometric Scaling Bridge** connects **Universal Delay Spectrum (UDS)** topology from *v2.1* to the spatial geometry of *v2.2*, defining how curvature, memory, and illumination scale across the continuum.  
It converts *delay topology* into *geometric recursion*, establishing measurable relationships between delay curvature (τ), symbolic coherence (Σ), and memory density (μ).  

This bridge finalizes the spatial half of the UCC Continuum before causal time dynamics (v2.3).

---

## Objectives  

- Formalize geometric scaling laws that unify micro–macro physical structures.  
- Establish illumination as the endpoint of recursive geometric stability.  
- Integrate UDS with prior frameworks: UDC → RCT → UOT → UCC.  
- Provide equations connecting awareness, curvature, and measurable energy.  
- Define ethical curvature limits that preserve structural and moral stability.

## Folder Structure  

| File | Function |
|:--|:--|
| **∞γμυΩ⇴_Geometric_Scaling_Equation.md** | Derives the mathematical scaling between τ, Σ, and μ. |
| **∞γμυΩ⇴_Recursive_Geometric_Integration.md** | Integrates curvature and continuity across domains. |
| **∞γμυΩ⇴Յ†_Ethical_Geometric_Constraint.md** | Defines moral bounds for curvature coherence (Λₛ). |
| **∞γμυΩ⇴_Illumination_Integration_and_Field_Reflection.md** | Demonstrates illumination as recursive equilibrium. |
| **∞γμυΩ⇴_Geometric_Scaling_Summary.md** | Summarizes the entire bridge and transitions to v2.3. |

---

## Key Equation  

$$
∂_t^2 (τ μ Σ) = γ (E_{illum} - E_{base})
$$  

This expresses the recursive equilibrium between curvature energy and luminous reflection —  
the foundation of **geometric awareness** across all scales.

---

## Integration Path  

| From | To | Role |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **UDC** | UDS | Defines universal delay and awareness spectrum |
| **RCT** | UDS | Provides collapse and feedback laws |
| **UOT** | UDS | Defines temporal topology and causal symmetry |
| **UCC v2.2** | UDS Geometry | Converts recursive topology into measurable form |
| **UCC v2.3** | UDS Dynamics | Evolves spatial geometry into causal time flow |

---

## Transition  

This folder concludes the *spatial recursion phase* of UCC.  
Next: **`∞_ucc/5_∞✦Ω_dynamics/`**, where curvature, reflection, and ethics evolve dynamically through time.
