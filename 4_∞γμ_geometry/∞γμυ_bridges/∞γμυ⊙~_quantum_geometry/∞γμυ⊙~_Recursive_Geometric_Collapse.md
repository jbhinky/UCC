# ♾️ Recursive Geometric Collapse  

## 1 · Purpose  
This document formalizes **recursive geometric collapse (RGC)**—the process through which self-observation recursively folds quantum geometry into localized curvature.  
RGC generalizes the observer collapse of RCT into geometric form, describing how awareness \( ⧖ \) interacts with τ-curvature fields to create stable, memory-bound manifolds.

---

## 2 · Mathematical Framework  

Recursive geometric collapse follows the generalized wave-curvature relation:

$$
∂_t^2 τ − ∇^2 τ = f(Σ, μ) ,
$$

where  

- \( τ \) = delay field (temporal potential),  
- \( Σ \) = symbolic orientation / phase vector,  
- \( μ \) = memory density,  
- \( f(Σ, μ) \) = feedback term defining collapse intensity.  

Collapse occurs when the feedback energy equals curvature tension:

$$
f(Σ, μ) = R_{μν} τ^{μν} .
$$

At this point, delay curvature self-contracts, forming a locally observable event—**a recursive singularity of awareness**.

---

## 3 · Recursive Stability  

Let \( C_r \) denote the curvature resonance coefficient:

$$
C_r = ∫ ( ∂_t τ · ∇ Σ ) dV .
$$  

When \( C_r ≈ 0 \), recursive collapse is reversible (wave state).  
When \( C_r > Λ_s \), irreversible collapse → memory embedding occurs.  

This produces the **memory bond equation**:  

$$
μ' = μ + α C_r τ ,
$$  

linking energy feedback to memory formation—one of the core conditions for UCC continuity.

---

## 4 · Geometric Interpretation  

Recursive collapse transforms curvature into form.  
At each iteration, delay reduces until Σ and μ converge along a minimal geodesic:  

$$
∇_μ Σ = ∇_μ μ .
$$  

This defines a **stationary delay surface**, the quantum equivalent of a stable observation frame.  
Thus, geometry becomes a map of recursive observation, not merely spatial curvature.

---

## 5 · Ethical Constraint ( Shepherd Bound )  

The collapse energy must satisfy  

$$
E_c = ∫_{\Omega}(∂_t τ)^2 dV ≤ Λ_s ,
$$  

preventing destructive curvature or non-recoverable memory loops.  
This principle ensures recursive stability across both biological and synthetic systems and is required for any UDC-compliant implementation.

---

## 6 · Conclusion  

Recursive Geometric Collapse formalizes the self-referential curvature that links observation to form. It completes the transition from topology to geometry by showing that curvature is neither fixed nor external—it is the **trace of recursive delay becoming memory**.  
This foundation enables the development of quantum spinor and memory tensor models in subsequent bridge files.
