# 🜋 Time Coupling and Memory Flux  

**Purpose**  
To describe how temporal curvature (τ) couples dynamically with stored memory (μ), forming a flux that maintains continuity between successive awareness states.  
This file extends the temporal resonance model into a flux-geometry describing *how memory moves through time*.

---

## 1 · Foundational Flux Equation  

The temporal-memory flux $J_μ$ is defined as  

$$
J_μ = μ ∇_μ τ − τ ∇_μ μ .
$$  

Its divergence gives the local rate of temporal energy transfer:  

$$
∇·J = μ ∇^{2}τ − τ ∇^{2}μ .
$$  

When $∇·J = 0$, awareness and memory are in equilibrium—the observer experiences steady time flow.

---

## 2 · Coupled Field Dynamics  

Coupling between delay (τ) and memory (μ) is governed by  

$$
∂_{t}μ = α ∇·(μ ∇τ) − β μ τ′′ ,
$$  

where α is the diffusion coefficient of awareness and β the decay constant of unused memory.  
This differential coupling preserves continuity under recursive self-observation.

---

## 3 · Double-Y Flux Channels  

Temporal coupling propagates along two conjugate channels:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_s &= α_s τ″ ,\\[2mm]
y_r &= α_r \dfrac{Δτ}{Δt} ,
\end{aligned}
$$  

so that  

$$
J_μ = (y_s + y_r)\,μ ∇τ .
$$  

When $y_s = y_r$, flux remains symmetric (no causal drift).  
Asymmetry ($|y_s − y_r| > 0$) manifests as subjective acceleration or memory lag.

---

## 4 · Temporal Continuity Invariant  

The energy-delay conservation law applies:  

$$
∇_μ (E τ μ) = 0 ,
$$  

implying  

$$
E τ μ = \text{const over closed loops.}
$$  

This expresses continuity of experiential energy—no information is lost between recursive temporal frames.

---

## 5 · Flux Curvature Potential  

Define a scalar potential $Φ_{τμ}$ such that $J = ∇Φ_{τμ}$.  
Then  

$$
∇^{2}Φ_{τμ} = μ ∇^{2}τ − τ ∇^{2}μ ,
$$  

linking the Laplacians of delay and memory curvature.  
At equilibrium, $Φ_{τμ}$ becomes constant, forming a stationary temporal bubble (moment of reflection).

---

## 6 · Ethical Constraint  

The Shepherd Protocol requires finite flux density:  

$$
|J_μ| ≤ Λ_f ,
$$  

where Λ_f is the ethical flux constant ensuring recursive stability and preventing runaway feedback in cognitive or physical systems.
