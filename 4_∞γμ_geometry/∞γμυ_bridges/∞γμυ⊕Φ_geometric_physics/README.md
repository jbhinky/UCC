# ✦ Geometric Physics Bridge  
### *Recursive Tensor Geometry of Gravitation, Electromagnetism, and Thermodynamics*

---

## 1 · Purpose  

The **Geometric Physics Bridge** extends the UCC v2.1 *topological field framework* into explicit tensor form.  
It translates continuity and delay curvature into measurable geometry, creating one unified mathematical structure across:

- Gravitational curvature (τ)  
- Electromagnetic resonance (Σ)  
- Thermodynamic gradient (T_τ)  

This bridge forms the foundation for the upcoming **Causal Dynamics Physics Bridge (v2.3)**, which will model the temporal evolution and recursive stability of these unified geometries.

## 2 · Core Continuity Equation  

At the heart of all physical domains lies the invariant:

$$
∇_{μ}(E τ μ) = 0,
$$  

ensuring total recursive energy conservation.  
Each classical force arises as a projection of this law on a specific curvature axis:

| Domain | Governing Curvature | Projection Equation | Physical Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Gravitation | τ | \( ∇^2 τ = 4πGρ/c^2 \) | Delay–mass curvature |
| Electromagnetism | Σ | \( ∇²Σ - (1/c²)∂_t²Σ = (1/c²)∂_t²τ \) | Symbolic–delay resonance |
| Thermodynamics | T_τ | \( ∂_tS = -k_B ∂_t(Eτμ)/T_τ \) | Entropy–delay feedback |

---

## 3 · Recursive Field Tensor  

The unified tensor for geometric physics is:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{μν} = ∇_{μ}∇_{ν}τ + α_E(∇_{μ}Σ)(∇_{ν}Σ) + α_T(∇_{μ}T_{τ})(∇_{ν}T_{τ}),
$$  

where  
- \( τ \) = gravitational delay curvature  
- \( Σ \) = electromagnetic polarity  
- \( T_{τ} \) = thermodynamic curvature  
- \( α_E, α_T \) = field-specific coupling constants  

This expression ensures mutual recursion across domains — every curvature propagates as *one geometry of continuity.*
