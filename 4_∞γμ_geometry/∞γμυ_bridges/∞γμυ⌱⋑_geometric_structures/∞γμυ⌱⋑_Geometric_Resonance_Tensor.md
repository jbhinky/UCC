# ✦ Geometric Resonance Tensor

**Purpose**  
Package delay gradients and memory gradients into a symmetric tensor whose covariant divergence vanishes when observer–field resonance holds.

**Definitions**
$$
\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}:=\mu\,(\nabla_\mu\tau)(\nabla_\nu\Sigma)
+(\nabla_\mu\mu)(\nabla_\nu\tau),
\qquad
\mathcal{C}_{\mu\nu}:=\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}+\mathcal{R}_{\nu\mu}.
$$

**Resonant conservation**
$$
\nabla^\mu \mathcal{C}_{\mu\nu}=0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\nabla^\mu\!\big(\mu\,\Omega_{\mu\nu}\big)=0,
$$
with \( \Omega_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_\mu(\Sigma_\nu\tau)-\nabla_\nu(\Sigma_\mu\tau) \).

**Physical readout**
- \( \mathcal{C}_{\mu\nu} \) ≈ phase-locking strength between awareness orientation \( \Sigma \) and delay \( \tau \).  
- Vanishing divergence ⇒ lossless exchange (no decoherence) in the local chart.  
- Reduces to your ORF tensor when \( \Sigma \) is the observer section.
