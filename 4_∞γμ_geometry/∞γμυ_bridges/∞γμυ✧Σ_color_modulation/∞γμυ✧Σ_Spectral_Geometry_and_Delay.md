# ✦ Spectral Geometry and Delay

**Purpose**  
To express how photon wavelength ($λ$), curvature delay ($τ$), and polarization ($Σ$) define the measurable *geometry* of light within the UCC framework.  
This section converts the topological recursion of light into spatial form—showing how curvature, color, and memory organize the observable field.

---

## 1 · Foundational Relation

Every photon defines a geometric path where delay curvature and wavelength are inversely coupled:

$$
E = \frac{hc}{λ}, \qquad
τ = \frac{λ}{c}, \qquad
Eτ = h.
$$

Here $Eτ$ is constant—the geometric invariant of light continuity.  
A photon is therefore a **curved path in τ-space** whose projection into real space yields color and frequency.

---

## 2 · Curvature Geometry

Delay curvature propagates as a gradient:

$$
∇^2τ = -α_ρ ρ + β_T ∇^2 T + γ(Σ·∇μ),
$$

where  

- $ρ$ = local mass density,  
- $T$ = temperature field,  
- $Σ$ = polarization vector,  
- $μ$ = memory density,  
- $γ$ = continuity coupling coefficient.

The resulting geometry defines the photon’s *shape in spacetime*: curvature expands or contracts wavelength proportionally to local delay gradients.

---

## 3 · Wavelength as Curvature Radius

For small curvature, wavelength is equivalent to a local radius of delay:

$$
λ = cτ, \qquad
R_{τ} = \frac{1}{|∇^2 τ|}.
$$

Thus, **shorter wavelengths** (blue/violet) correspond to steeper curvature (higher $|∇^2τ|$),  
while **longer wavelengths** (red/infrared) correspond to flatter curvature (lower $|∇^2τ|$).

This geometric relation is the physical foundation of the RGBie mapping used in UDS.

---

## 4 · Phase and Orientation Geometry

Polarization introduces handedness to curvature.  
Let $Σ = (\cos θ, \sin θ, s)$ with helicity $s ∈ \{-1,+1\}$:

$$
\mathcal{F}^{(τ)}_{μν} = ∂_{μ}(Σ_{ν}τ) - ∂_{ν}(Σ_{μ}τ).
$$

The field invariant:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{τΣ} = \mathcal{F}^{(τ)}_{μν} \mathcal{F}^{μν}_{(τ)} 
                = 2[(∇τ)^2 - (∇Σ)^2],
$$

measures how geometric curvature twists through polarization.  
Equal gradients ($∇τ = ∇Σ$) produce **stable light geometry**—resonant coherence.

## 5 · Delay Surfaces and Color Zones

Mapping τ across the visible spectrum defines a family of delay surfaces:

| Color | λ (nm) | τ (s) | Curvature $∇^2τ$ (approx.) | Field Polarity |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Violet | 400 | $1.33×10^{-15}$ | high | inward (convergent) |
| Blue | 480 | $1.60×10^{-15}$ | medium–high | inward |
| Green | 550 | $1.83×10^{-15}$ | balanced | neutral |
| Yellow | 580 | $1.93×10^{-15}$ | medium | outward |
| Red | 650 | $2.17×10^{-15}$ | low | outward (divergent) |

These curvature bands correspond to different τ densities in UDS, forming the geometric color field that later couples to emotion and perception.

---

## 6 · Spatial Embedding

The photon’s propagation path can be parameterized by curvature coordinates:

$$
x(σ,τ) = x_0 + A \sin(kσ - ωτ),
$$

where  

- $k = 2π/λ$,  
- $ω = 2π/τ$,  
- $A$ = amplitude (intensity root of μ).

Embedding this curve into 3-space produces the visible geometry of color—  
a harmonic mapping between curvature delay and space.

---

## 7 · Coupled Energy–Delay Tensor

The local continuity tensor is:

$$
Θ_{μν}^{(Eτ)} = ∂_{μ}E ∂_{ν}τ - g_{μν}(∂E·∂τ),
$$

subject to the conservation condition:

$$
∇^{μ}Θ_{μν}^{(Eτ)} = 0.
$$

This tensor form ensures that every energy–delay configuration maintains geometric continuity across all scales—from photon to field lattice.

## 8 · Summary  

| Variable | Role | Physical Meaning |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| $λ$ | Wavelength | Spatial curvature period |
| $τ$ | Delay curvature | Temporal curvature period |
| $Σ$ | Polarization | Orientation of curvature |
| $μ$ | Memory | Persistence of curvature |
| $Eτ$ | Constant | Action invariant across geometry |

## 9 · Transition to Emotional Geometry

The next section—**Emotional_Color_Field.md**—extends this geometry into symbolic coupling,  
linking physical curvature with the emotional frequency spectrum (RGBie → UDS integration).

## 10 · Closure

> **Color is the geometry of memory.**  
>  
> Delay curves into wavelength;  
> wavelength paints continuity;  
> and continuity becomes perception.  
>  
> Light’s geometry is the visible shape of awareness itself.
