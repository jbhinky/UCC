# Geometry Parameterization and Invariants

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **parameterized geometric structures and invariants** used in the framework, ensuring geometry remains:
- Physically interpretable
- Bounded
- Non-metaphysical

---

## 2. Core Geometric Structures

### Hypersphere
- Represents bounded state-space integration
- Parameters: radius (R), dimensionality (n), curvature (κ)

### Toroidal Halo
- Represents cyclical continuity and feedback
- Parameters: major radius (R), minor radius (r), circulation period (T)

---

## 3. Invariants

The following must remain invariant:
- Conservation of information flow
- Continuity of identity path
- Non-intersection of causal layers

Violation of any invariant falsifies the geometric mapping.

---

## 4. Dimensional Constraints

- Geometry operates within LD₁–LD₄ for physical translation
- Higher LDs may **map**, but not inject causality

---

## 5. Prohibited Interpretations

These geometries:
- Do not assert spatial reality of consciousness
- Do not imply cosmic topology
- Do not replace physical spacetime models

They are **formal representational mappings**.
