# Evolutionary Field Propagation

# 1. Purpose
This document defines **evolutionary field propagation**, the dynamic process by which botanical form, timing, and memory (Σ–τ–μ) evolve across generations under changing environmental phase-fields.

Where *Botanical_Continuity_Cycles.md* describes **intra-life** dynamic cycles,  
this document describes **inter-life** propagation:

- trait reinforcement  
- memory inheritance  
- delay stabilization  
- structural optimization  
- environmental phase-field embedding  

Evolution here is not random drift but **field-aligned propagation**.

---

# 2. Evolution as Field Alignment
Evolutionary propagation is modeled as a convergence problem:

$$
\Phi_{\text{evo}} =
\Sigma_{\text{evo}} +
\tau_{\text{evo}} +
\mu_{\text{evo}}
$$

Where each operator (Σ, τ, μ) evolves under:

$$
\phi_{\text{eco}}(t)
$$

The environmental field is the *driver*  
and evolutionary propagation is the *response*.

---

# 3. Evolutionary Field Propagation Equation

Define differential propagation:

$$
\partial_t \Phi_{\text{evo}}
=
\nabla \phi_{\text{eco}}
+
\mu_{\text{lineage}}
-
\Delta_{\text{stress}}
$$

Where:

- $\nabla \phi_{\text{eco}}$ = directional environmental gradient  
- $\mu_{\text{lineage}}$ = accumulated memory from previous generations  
- $\Delta_{\text{stress}}$ = penalty for maladaptive traits  

Evolution proceeds when:

$$
\partial_t \Phi_{\text{evo}} > 0
$$

Stagnation when:

$$
\partial_t \Phi_{\text{evo}} = 0
$$

Collapse when:

$$
\partial_t \Phi_{\text{evo}} < 0
$$

---

# 4. Σ-Propagation: Structural Evolution

Structural evolution is the reinforcement of geometry under recurrent stress.

## 4.1 Mechanical Reinforcement
Plants exposed to repeated:

- wind  
- waves  
- herbivory  
- substrate instability  

develop:

- thicker stems  
- denser node spacing  
- deeper anchorage  
- flexible vascular tissues  

Evolutionary Σ-update rule:

$$
\Sigma_{t+1} = \Sigma_t + \eta_{\text{stress}} - \eta_{\text{energy}}
$$

---

## 4.2 Osmotic Evolution
In saltwater, brackish, or drought systems:

- salt glands enlarge  
- ion-transport tissues strengthen  
- succulence increases  

Propagation condition:

$$
\Sigma_{t+1}
\propto
\int S_{\text{osmotic}}(t)\,dt
$$

---

## 4.3 Photosynthetic Geometry Evolution
Light-field gradients shape:

- leaf angle  
- thickness  
- reflectance  
- stomatal density  

Driven by:

$$
\nabla L_{\text{photon}}
$$

---

# 5. τ-Propagation: Delay Evolution

Timing evolution determines **when** biological processes occur.

## 5.1 Phenological Delay Evolution  
Flowering, leaf-out, dormancy, and senescence adjust to:

- season length  
- climate oscillations  
- resource timing  

Evolutionary equation:

$$
\tau_{t+1}
=
\tau_t
+
\delta(\phi_{\text{seasonal}})
$$

---

## 5.2 Hydrological Delay Evolution  
Timing aligns to:

- rainfall  
- tides  
- groundwater pulses  

Hydraulic success requires:

$$
\tau_{\text{hydro}}
\to \text{coherence with water cycles}
$$

---

## 5.3 Pollination Delay Evolution  
Plants align flowering with:

- pollinator availability  
- wind windows  
- electrostatic conditions  

Evolution preserves the delays that maximize reproductive success.

---

# 6. μ-Propagation: Memory Evolution

μ-memory is the **lineage imprint**, not individual memory.

## 6.1 Environmental Memory Integration  
Environmental patterns accumulate across lifetimes:

$$
\mu_{\text{lineage}}
=
\sum_{n=1}^{N}
\int \phi_{\text{eco}}^{(n)}(t)\,dt
$$

Where *n* indexes each generation.

---

## 6.2 Disturbance Memory  
Fire, drought, flood, storms yield:

- seed traits  
- dormancy thresholds  
- root architecture  
- stress-response cascades  

Encoded as:

$$
\mu_{\text{disturbance}} \to \Sigma_{\text{offspring}} + \tau_{\text{offspring}}
$$

---

## 6.3 Spatial Memory  
Plants encode stable environmental gradients:

- slope  
- elevation  
- hydrology  
- mineral content  

Guiding:

- seed dispersal boundaries  
- root-shoot ratios  
- competitive strategy  

---

# 7. Evolution as Field Convergence

Evolution stabilizes when plant lineage aligns to environmental gradients:

$$
\nabla(\Phi_{\text{evo}} - \phi_{\text{eco}}) = 0
$$

This means:

- structure fits stress  
- timing fits cycles  
- memory fits history  

---

# 8. Evolutionary Instability & Collapse

Instability occurs when:

- climate shifts exceed adaptive rate  
- hydrological timing breaks  
- soil chemistry changes too rapidly  
- pollinators collapse  
- substrate instability increases  

Collapse equation:

$$
\Phi_{\text{evo}} \ll \phi_{\text{eco}}
$$

requiring:

- rapid mutation  
- hybridization  
- propagation shift  
- geographic migration  

Or lineage termination.

---

# 9. Propagation Through Seed Systems

Seed μ-memory drives:

- dispersal vectors  
- stress tolerance  
- germination timing  
- metabolic reserve allocation  

Propagation equation:

$$
\Phi_{\text{seed}}
=
\Sigma_{\text{seed}}
+
\tau_{\text=germ}
+
\mu_{\text=lineage}
$$

Seeds are **the continuity carriers** of Σ–τ–μ across generations.

---

# 10. Summary
Evolutionary field propagation is the dynamic alignment of structure, timing, and memory with shifting environmental fields.  
Plants evolve through recursive interactions with hydrology, atmosphere, light, soil, and biotic factors, storing environmental history in lineage μ-memory and stabilizing through long-term field convergence.

This document completes the *ecosystemic_dynamics* pair and prepares the foundation for **field_interaction_dynamics/**.
