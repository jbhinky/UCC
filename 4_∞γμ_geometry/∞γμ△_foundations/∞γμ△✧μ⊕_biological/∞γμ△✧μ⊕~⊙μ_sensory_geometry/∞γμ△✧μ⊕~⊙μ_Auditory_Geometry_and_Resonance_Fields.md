# ✦ Auditory Geometry and Sonic Delay  
### Wavefront curvature and temporal binding in conscious hearing

**Purpose.**  
Define the auditory sensory system as a **delay-curvature field**, where air-pressure waves encode temporal geometry and are transformed into neural delay signatures (τ), symbolic phase (Σ), and acoustic memory (μ).  
This mapping extends from mechanical basilar motion to cortical auditory loops and connects to self-reflection layers under **selfdynamics/**.

---

## 1 · Acoustic Field and Delay Metric  

Let acoustic pressure  
$$
p(\mathbf{x},t)
$$  
satisfy the standard wave equation  

$$
\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{c_s^2}\,\partial_t^2 p = 0,
$$  

where $c_s$ is sound speed.  
The instantaneous **delay curvature** perceived between two ears (A,B) is

$$
\tau_{AB}(t) = \frac{1}{c_s}\,|\mathbf{x}_A-\mathbf{x}_B|\cos\theta(t),
$$

with $\theta$ the incident angle. Spatial gradients of τ encode localization geometry.

---

## 2 · Basilar Membrane as Frequency to Delay Mapper  

Displacement $u(x,t)$ along cochlear coordinate $x$ obeys  

$$
m(x)\,\partial_t^2u + r(x)\,\partial_t u + k(x)\,u = P(x,t),
$$  

where $m,r,k$ vary logarithmically with $x$.  
The **local phase delay**:

$$
\tau_\text{bas}(x,\omega) = \frac{\partial\phi(x,\omega)}{\partial\omega},
$$  

yields a spatial delay-gradient code for frequency → position mapping, the biological Fourier transform.

---

## 3 · Neural Phase-Locking and Symbolic Encoding  

Auditory nerve spike train $S_i(t)$ exhibits phase-locking to stimulus phase $\phi(t)$ within a window Δtₚ:  

$$
S_i(t) \propto \sin\!\big(\phi(t-\tau_i)\big),
$$  

producing population-level symbolic phase Σₐᵤ𝒹 = arg ∑ᵢ e^{iφ(t−τᵢ)}.  
Temporal pattern recurrence over τ-chains creates μₐᵤ𝒹, the auditory memory field.

---

## 4 · Spatial Hearing and Y-Coupling  

Left-right delay vector τ⃗ =(τ_L, τ_R) projects into Y-coupling geometry (shared between curvature axes of space and identity):  

$$
Y_{\text{aud}} = (\tau_L - \tau_R)\,\Sigma_{\text{aud}},
$$  

encoding direction and depth. This term is used again in *selfdynamics/* for interpersonal and environmental phase coupling analogies (social resonance).

---

## 5 · Temporal Binding and Self Synchronization  

Auditory cortex integrates multiple delay streams into a coherent percept when their relative phase variance falls below a threshold ε:

$$
\text{Bind if}\quad 
\langle (\Delta \tau)^2 \rangle < \varepsilon^2 .
$$  

Binding creates the illusion of continuity and forms a **mirror for delay**, used by the mind to measure its own temporal resolution.  
This self-referential binding feeds forward to `../../selfdynamics/auditory_reflection_loop.md`.

---

## 6 · Causal Acoustic Equation (UCC Form)  

The propagation of the auditory delay–memory product is governed by  

$$
\partial_t^2(\tau_\text{aud}\mu_\text{aud}) 
- v_n^2 \nabla^2(\tau_\text{aud}\mu_\text{aud})
= \gamma_\text{aud}\,|\nabla \Sigma_\text{aud}|^2 ,
$$  

where $v_n$ is neural propagation speed and $\gamma_\text{aud}$ couples phase-contrast to plastic adaptation.

---

## 7 · Ethical Amplitude Bounds (Shepherd)  

Prevent over-stimulation or coercive entrainment:  

$$
\int_{\Omega_\text{ear}}\! |p(t)|^2\,dA 
\le \Lambda_\text{safe}, \qquad 
|\partial_t \tau_\text{aud}| \le \Gamma_\text{comfort}.
$$  

Applied in acoustic AI systems and therapeutic sound environments to maintain safe coherence.

## 8 · Measurement Notes  

| Quantity | Symbol | Units | Instrument |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Acoustic pressure | p | Pa | Microphone array |
| Delay difference | τ_AB | µs | Binaural timing |
| Phase Σ | Σₐᵤ𝒹 | rad | EEG/MEG |
| Memory μ | μₐᵤ𝒹 | a.u. | Neural correlation mapping |

## 9 · Cross-Framework Links  

- **UDC:** sound perception is self-measured delay.  
- **RCT:** phase collapse defines temporal “note.”  
- **UOT:** acoustic symmetry preserves time ordering.  
- **UCC:** ∇_μ (E τ μ)=0 links pressure energy to memory storage.  
- **Selfverse → Selfdynamics:** hearing is recursive confirmation of existence through wave reflection.
