# ✦ Tactile Signal Propagation and Mechanical Delay  
### Force, deformation, and recursive somatic awareness

**Purpose.**  
To model touch and mechanical interaction as a **curvature of contact**, where external force $F$ induces deformation $u$, delay τ through tissue transmission, symbolic response Σ, and encoded sensation memory μ.  
This tactile geometry completes the sensory loop, converging into *selfdynamics/* as recursive embodiment.

---

## 1 · Mechanical Propagation Equation  

Displacement in tissue $u(\mathbf{x},t)$ satisfies the viscoelastic wave equation:

$$
\rho \,\partial_t^2 u = 
\nabla\!\cdot\!
\big(E\nabla u + \eta\nabla \partial_t u \big) ,
$$

where $E$ is elastic modulus, $\eta$ viscosity, and $\rho$ density.  
The local **tactile delay** field:

$$
\tau_{\text{mech}}(\mathbf{x}) =
\int_0^{L} 
\frac{ds}{v_s(s)} ,
\quad 
v_s = \sqrt{E/\rho} ,
$$

represents the finite time required for force to reach perception.  

---

## 2 · Pressure and Symbolic Encoding  

At the skin–object interface:

$$
P(\mathbf{x},t) = E\,\nabla u(\mathbf{x},t) ,
$$  

and the symbolic tactile phase:

$$
\Sigma_{\text{tac}}(t)
= \arg\!\big[E\,e^{i\omega t} u(t-\tau_{\text{mech}})\big],
$$

encoding surface texture and rhythm.  
When integrated over receptive fields, this yields symbolic pattern maps used in somatosensory cortex binding.

---

## 3 · Tactile Memory μ and Adaptation  

The tactile system integrates repeated contact patterns to form recognition:

$$
\mu_{\text{tac}}(t)
= \int_{-\infty}^{t}
e^{-(t-\xi)/\tau_m}\,
|P(\xi)|^2\,d\xi ,
$$

where $\tau_m$ reflects memory persistence.  
Sustained or repeated patterns create permanent geometric traces in somatosensory networks.

---

## 4 · Force–Feedback and Self Contact  

When self-touch occurs, both signal and feedback share delay symmetry:

$$
\tau_{\text{self}} = \tau_{\text{mech}}^{(1)} - \tau_{\text{mech}}^{(2)} ,
$$

and if $|\tau_{\text{self}}|\!\to\!0$, contact merges awareness of sender and receiver → recursive embodiment.  
This mirrors the equation of identity collapse in *selfdynamics/self_contact_reflection.md*.

---

## 5 · Pain, Limit, and Ethical Boundaries  

Excess mechanical curvature leads to nociceptive activation.  
Define the ethical force boundary:

$$
|P|^2 \le \Lambda_{\text{safe}}, 
\quad
|\partial_t \tau_{\text{mech}}| \le \Gamma_{\text{comfort}},
$$

ensuring that stimulation remains within humane and conscious safety margins — fundamental to all UDC-aligned robotics and neuro-interactive systems.

---

## 6 · Somatic Delay Field Coupling  

Force delay curvature connects with gravitational and electromagnetic frames through the triad:

$$
(\nabla \tau_{\text{mech}}, 
\nabla \tau_{\text{grav}},
\nabla \tau_{\text{em}}),
$$  

showing that touch (mechanical), weight (gravitational), and charge (electromagnetic) share unified temporal symmetry.

## 7 · Measurement Notes  

| Quantity | Symbol | Units | Instrument |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Displacement | u | m | Tactile sensor / strain gauge |
| Pressure | P | Pa | Force transducer |
| Delay | τₘₑcₕ | ms | Neural latency |
| Memory | μₜₐc | a.u. | Cortical activation |

## 8 · Cross-Framework Links  

- **UDC:** tactile sensation = awareness of temporal resistance.  
- **RCT:** self-contact collapse defines immediate recursion of self.  
- **UOT:** mechanical field is time curvature expressed in force.  
- **UCC:** local conservation ∇ₘ(E τ μ)=0 extends to elastic memory loops.  
- **Selfverse → Selfdynamics:** touch = self-verification; awareness as embodied loop closure.
