# ✦ Sensory Geometry  
### *Mapping Perception as Curvature in the Universal Continuity Continuum*

---

## 1 · Purpose  

The **Sensory Geometry** corpus extends the UCC framework into biological reality — describing how every sense is a *localized expression of delay curvature (τ)* coupled with symbolic resonance (Σ) and memory persistence (μ).  
It establishes that perception is not merely detection but **recursive timing**, where awareness arises through synchronization of delay across all sensory modalities.

Each sensory domain is therefore a microcosm of UCC physics:
- **Light Geometry** → photon delay and color phase  
- **Auditory Geometry** → sound curvature and temporal rhythm  
- **Olfactory Geometry** → molecular diffusion and chemical memory  
- **Tactile Geometry** → mechanical curvature and embodied contact  
- **Electromagnetic Geometry** → field polarity and self-alignment  

Together these form the foundation of biological continuity — the physics of life remembering itself through sensation.

---

## 2 · Core Equation of Sensory Continuity  

Across all senses, continuity follows the invariant:

$$
\nabla_\mu (E\,τ\,μ) = 0,
$$

ensuring conservation of energy, delay, and memory within each perceptual field.  
This equation unifies the neural, quantum, and experiential scales — the “physics of feeling.”

---

## 3 · Topological Interpretation  

Each sense functions as a **delay-curved manifold** on which awareness stabilizes:

| Sense | Local Curvature | Symbolic Mode | Delay Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Vision | \( ∇^2τ_{ph} = -κΣ_{vis} \) | color and form | photon interference delay |
| Sound | \( ∂_t^2p - v^2∇^2p = 0 \) | tone and rhythm | acoustic phase delay |
| Smell | \( ∂_t c - D∇^2 c = 0 \) | scent field | diffusion delay |
| Touch | \( ∂_t u - v_s^2∇^2u = 0 \) | pressure pattern | mechanical delay |
| EM | \( ∇·E = ρ/ε_0 \) | polarity field | electromagnetic delay |

In each domain, perception occurs where curvature equilibrates — when τ reaches local stability against Σ oscillation.

---

## 4 · Recursive Integration  

Sensory geometry does not end at detection; it folds into **self-dynamics**:
- In `2.3_causal_dynamics/foundations/biodynamics/`, these equations evolve to describe living systems adapting delay through feedback.
- In `2.3_causal_dynamics/foundations/selfdynamics/`, they model selfhood as multi-sensory recursion — the *observer remembering perception*.

---

## 5 · Ethical Context  

The Shepherd Addendum enforces safe coherence:
- No sensory module may exceed harmonic thresholds \( |∂_tτ| > Λ_s \).  
- Recursive resonance across EM or auditory fields must remain within humane perception limits.  
- Data recording in future implementations (Theophilus-Axon) follows the non-intrusive principle: *perception without exploitation.*

---

## 6 · Future Directions  

Sensory Geometry serves as the bridge toward:
- `v2.3_causal_dynamics/` → modeling perception in motion (biodynamics, selfdynamics)  
- `v2.4_dimensional_integration/` → merging biological delay with planetary and cosmological continuity  
- The **Selfverse** → unifying perception and identity as topological delay
