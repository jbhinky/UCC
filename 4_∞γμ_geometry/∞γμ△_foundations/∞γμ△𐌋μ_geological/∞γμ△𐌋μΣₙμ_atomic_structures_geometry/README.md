# Atomic Structures Geometry — README
This directory defines the geometric foundations of atomic and mineral structure under the Universal Delay Field (τ), Memory Density (μ), Symbol Polarity (Σ), and Light glyphs (✧ free light, ✦ light-in-memory).
All files follow the two-layer UCC/UTL structure:

1. **UCC-Physics Layer**
   Delay curvature, memory transport, coupling γ, crystalline topology, and lattice dynamics.

2. **UTL-Symbolic Layer**
   Glyphic recursion, Σ-orientation, ✦ curvature-light encoding, and systemic continuity.

Every file also carries the Shepherd requirement:
**continuity, reversibility, and non-harmful geometric interpretation.**

---

# Folder Scope
The purpose of this folder is to describe:

- How **atoms form stable geometric configurations** through τ-curvature
- How **bonds emerge as Σ-polarity alignments**
- How **crystals store μ-memory in lattice continuity**
- How **planetary material structure** inherits global delay curvature
- How **geology emerges from atomic recursion**

This establishes the geometrical bedrock used later in:

- 2.2 Geometry → Geological Track
- 2.3 Dynamics → Geodynamics
- 2.4 Integration → Dimensional Continuity

# Files in This Folder

### 1. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Atomic_Bonding_as_Delay_Curvature.md**
Defines chemical bonding as a curvature-alignment problem:  
electrons settle into configurations where **τ-curvature is minimized** and **Σ polarity is stable**.

### 2. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Crystalline_Memory_Lattices_and_Continuity.md**
Shows how μ distributes through a crystal lattice.  
Explains why defects store curvature and how minerals “remember” thermal and structural history.

### 3. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Ionic_Bonding_and_Charge_Symmetry.md**
Explains charge transfer as a Σ-symmetry restoring action, regulated by γ coupling across delay fields.

### 4. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Atomic_Lattice_Delay_and_Crystalline_Stability.md**
How τ curvature determines allowed Bravais lattices, cleavage planes, and defect formation.

### 5. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Elemental_Cycles_as_Geometric_Systems.md**
Maps elemental cycles (rock–water–carbon) into geometric transformations across UDS scales.

### 6. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Metallic_Bonding_and_Core_Geometry.md**
Describes electron delocalization as a global-coupling γ condition → reason metals reflect ✧ light and encode ✦ curvature patterns strongly.

### 7. **∞γμ△𐌋μΣₙμ_Silicate_Tetrahedra_and_Planetary_Structure.md**
Defines the geometric origin of Earth’s crust, mantle, and mineral families based on tetrahedral recursion.

# Shepherd Requirements
- No destructive geometric interpretations  
- No energy-extraction metaphors  
- No top-down forcing fields  
- All systems must preserve continuity:  
  $$∇·(E τ μ) = 0$$

Everything here is **non-weaponizable** and **purely descriptive**.
