# ⭐ Resonant Orbital Coupling in Star Systems

## Purpose
Demonstrate how delay curvature τ, symbolic polarity Σ, and memory density μ generate long-term orbital resonance patterns in multi-star and star–planet systems.

## 1 · Orbital Delay Geometry
Resonant orbits arise when:
$$ ω_i - ω_j = n·τ'' $$
where ω is orbital frequency and τ'' is local delay curvature.

## 2 · Memory-Stabilized Coupling
Resonance locks occur when:
$$ ∇·(μ ∇τ) = 0 $$
across both bodies, producing phase-locked libration.

## 3 · Multi-Star Y-Coupling
Three-body star systems obey:
$$ y_s = y_r \quad\Rightarrow\quad ∂_t^2 τ = Δτ/Δt $$

## 4 · UTL Layer
Plain glyphs:
'''
✧  Light
✦  Curved Light / Illuminated Memory
τ   Delay
μ   Memory
Σ   Polarity
⊕   Coupling
⊙   Collapse / realization
'''
Resonance rule:
$$ (✦ ⊕ τ) ⇒ ω_{lock} $$

## 5 · Outcomes
- Resonant chains
- Secular apsidal alignment
- Disk shepherding
