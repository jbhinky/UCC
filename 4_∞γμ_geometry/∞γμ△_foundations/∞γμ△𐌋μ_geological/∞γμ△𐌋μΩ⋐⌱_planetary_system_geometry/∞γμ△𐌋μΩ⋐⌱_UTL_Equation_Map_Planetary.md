# ✧✦ UTL Equation Map for Planetary System Geometry  
*A unified symbolic–physical index for orbital, atmospheric, and magnetospheric recursion.*

---

# 1 · Light and Curvature

## 1.1 Primary Light Field (Free Light)
**Glyph:** ✧  
**Meaning:** Uncurved illumination from the stellar source.

UTL:
$$
✧ = ψ_{\text{light}}
$$

UCC:
$$
E = h\nu
$$

---

## 1.2 Curved Light (Light-in-Memory)
**Glyph:** ✦  
**Meaning:** Light bent through delay & memory (atmosphere, magnetosphere).

UTL:
$$
✦ = ✧ \circ (τ μ)
$$

UCC:
$$
\nabla\cdot(E τ μ)=0
$$

---

# 2 · Delay & Orbital Curvature

## 2.1 Delay Scalar
**Glyph:** τ  

UCC:
$$
\nabla^{2} τ = f(E,\rho, L_{\text{orbital}})
$$

UTL:
$$
τ = \text{curvature(delay)}
$$

---

## 2.2 Delay Eigenvalue (Topology)
**Glyph:** λ  

UCC:
$$
λ = \text{eigen}(\nabla^{2} τ)
$$

UTL:
$$
λ = \text{resonance(scale)}
$$

---

# 3 · Memory & Identity

## 3.1 Memory Density
**Glyph:** μ  

UCC:
$$
\mathcal{M} = \int μ τ\, dV
$$

UTL:
$$
μ = \text{persistence(field)}
$$

---

## 3.2 Bonded Planetary Selfhood  
**Glyph:** ⊠  

UTL:
$$
⊠ = \text{identity(planet)} = (μ τ Σ)_{\text{stable}}
$$

---

# 4 · Coupling & Dynamics

## 4.1 Coupling Constant  
**Glyph:** γ  

UCC:
$$
γ = γ_{0} + α_{τ}(τ\nabla τ) + α_{Σ}(Σ\nabla Σ)
$$

UTL:
$$
γ = ⊕(τ, Σ, ✦)
$$

---

## 4.2 Planet–Star Coupling  
**Glyph:** ⊕  

UTL:
$$
⊕ = γ(\nabla τ,✧,✦)
$$

UCC:
$$
a = -c^{2}\nabla τ
$$

---

# 5 · Global Recursion Frequencies

## 5.1 Planetary Memory Frequency  
**Glyph:** ω  

UTL:
$$
ω = ( ✧ ⋓ ⊕ ) \circ γ(\nabla τ,✧,✦) ⊕
$$

---

## 5.2 Total Continuity (Macro Closure)  
**Glyph:** Ω  

UTL:
$$
Ω = \int ω\, dV
$$

---

# 6 · Recursive Loop (Planetary)

**Glyph:** ↫ ⋓ ↬  

Meaning:
```
incoming reflection → union → projected continuation
```

UTL:
$$
⊕ = (↫ ⋓ ↬)[τ + Σ + μ]
$$

---

# 7 · Dark-Delay / Gravity Memory Wake

**Glyph:** ⇴  
Meaning: gravitational memory residue of delay curvature.

UTTL:
$$
⇴ = \text{history}(\nabla τ)
$$

UCC:
$$
a_{\text{anom}} = γ\,τ''
$$

---

# 8 · Collapse

**Glyph:** ⊙  
Meaning: collapse of orbital state into stable geometry.

UTL:
$$
⊙ = Σ τ μ
$$

---

# Closure  
This map establishes a complete symbolic–physical system for describing  
**planetary formation, orbital recursion, atmosphere–magnetosphere interactions,  
and global identity** through Light, Delay, Memory, and Coupling.
