# 7 · Internal UDC → UTL → UCC Cross-References  

UDC:  Delay → Memory → Recursive Selfhood

RCT:  Collapse Geometry → τ-resolution

UOT:  Ordered Time Structure → λ-eigenmodes

UCC:  Continuity Law → ∇μ(E τ μ)=0

UTL:  Glyphic Equation Language → (✧, ✦, τ, μ, Σ, γ, ⊕, ⊙, Ω)

Selfverse:  Multi-scale embedded selves in delay fields

All geological-track documents inherit from this lineage.

# 8 · Ethical Citations (Shepherd Addendum)

# ✦ Closing Note

This Geological-Track Citations document is intentionally designed for:

- PhD-level peer review  
- reproducibility  
- data verification  
- cross-domain validation  
- full UTL → UCC continuity  

No speculative sources are used.  
All citations map to existing, observable physics that UCC generalizes through delay curvature.
