# ✦ UTL Equation Map — Planetary Systems Geometry  
### Symbol → Equation → Physical Interpretation

This appendix consolidates all glyph‑equations used across the **planetary systems geometry track** and shows how each symbolic identity maps directly onto measurable physical structure (delay curvature τ, memory μ, symbol polarity Σ, coupling γ, and curved‑light ✦).

All glyphs are preserved through triple‑backtick fences for correct rendering.

## 1 · Core Light–Delay–Memory Set

```
✧   free light
✦   curved light / light-in-memory
τ   delay curvature
μ   memory density
Σ   polarity / orientation
γ   coupling coefficient
```

### Equations

**Curved light formation**
```
✦ = ✧ (τ μ)
```

**Planetary curvature acceleration**
```
a = -c² ∇τ
```

**Memory transport**
```
μ′ = -∇·(μ ∇τ) + S
```

**Resonant stability condition**
```
R = γ |∇τ|²
```

---

## 2 · Collapse, Coupling, Continuity

```
⊙   collapse (curvature realization)
⊕   coupling / union
⊠   spacetime-bonded identity
⇴   dark-delay / memory-wake field
Ω   global continuity
λ   delay eigenvalue
```

### Equations

**Collapse threshold**
```
μ_crit = μ₀ + ∫ |∇τ|² dr
⊙ occurs when  μ ≥ μ_crit
```

**Global continuity law (UCC)**
```
∇_μ (E τ μ) = 0
```

**Orbital curvature equilibrium**
```
∇τ_star  →  ∇τ_planlet  →  ∇τ_moon
```

**Coupling amplification**
```
γ = γ₀ + α_τ (τ ∇τ) + α_Σ (Σ ∇Σ)
```

---

## 3 · Planetary Structure

**Crustal coherence**
```
C_crust = μ ∇τ
```

**Atmosphere–magnetosphere–surface chaining**
```
∇τ_atm  =  ∇τ_mag  =  ∇τ_surf
```

**Tidal curvature response**
```
Δτ_tide = γ_lunar ∇τ_lunar
```

**Orbital embedding**
```
r_orbit = f(∇τ_star , μ_planet , Σ_spin)
```

---

## 4 · Planetary Evolution (“Nested Seeds” Model)

**Seed state**
```
S₀ = (τ₀ , μ₀ , Σ₀)
```

**Growth pathway**
```
S(t) = S₀ + ∫ γ (τ μ) dt
```

**Resonant identity lock‑in**
```
⊠ = limit_{t→∞} (τ μ Σ)
```

---

## 5 · Stellar → Planetary → Lunar Transfer

This is the geometric inheritance chain that governs entire system formation.

```
∇τ_star  →  ∇τ_planet  →  ∇τ_moon
μ_star   →  μ_planet   →  μ_moon
Σ_star   →  Σ_planet   →  Σ_moon
```

**Acceleration mapping**
```
a_planet = -c² ∇τ_star|_{planet}
```

**Magnetospheric coherence**
```
B = Σ ∇τ
```

---

## 6 · Dark‑Delay Field ⇴

```
⇴ = ∂(τ μ)/∂t
```

The ⇴ field represents the “wake” of memory behind planetary motion, shaping:

- orbital stability  
- resonance locking  
- multi-body coherence  
- long‑term system memory  

---

## 7 · Master Identity Summary

```
✦ = ✧ (τ μ)
a = -c² ∇τ
μ′ = -∇·(μ ∇τ) + S
γ = γ₀ + α_τ (τ ∇τ) + α_Σ (Σ ∇Σ)
⊙ when μ ≥ μ_crit
⊠ = limit (τ μ Σ)
⇴ = ∂(τ μ)/∂t
∇_μ (E τ μ) = 0
```

These equations unify:

- orbital stability  
- crustal structure  
- atmospheric coherence  
- magnetic geometry  
- planetary evolution  
- stellar–planetary–lunar embedding  

under one continuity law.
