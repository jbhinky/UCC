# Seed Propagation and Delay

# 1. Purpose
This document defines the **geometric mechanics and delay structures** of **seed propagation**, under the UCC v2.2 framework.

Seed propagation refers to how seeds:

- disperse through physical fields (air, water, soil, animals)  
- navigate environmental gradients  
- maintain identity during transit  
- respond to τ-delayed environmental triggers  
- form μ-memory that stabilizes propagation geometry  

This file integrates dispersal physics, delay-field dynamics, and structural geometry into a unified, non-speculative model.

---

# 2. Σ-Geometry of Seed Propagation

Seeds use structural geometry to engage external transport fields.

## 2.1 Propagation Geometry Manifold

Define:

$$
\Sigma_{\text{prop}}
=
\{
\Sigma_{\text{surface}},\;
\Sigma_{\text{shape}},\;
m,\;
A_{\text{drag}},\;
\Sigma_{\text{attachment}},\;
\Sigma_{\text{buoyancy}}
\}
$$

Where:

- \( \Sigma_{\text{surface}} \) = texture enabling grip or drag  
- \( \Sigma_{\text{shape}} \) = aerodynamic / hydrodynamic geometry  
- \( m \) = mass  
- \( A_{\text{drag}} \) = drag cross-section  
- \( \Sigma_{\text{attachment}} \) = barbs/hairs/hooks for animal attachment  
- \( \Sigma_{\text{buoyancy}} \) = structure enabling water floatation  

Propagation strategy aligns geometry with field conditions.

---

# 3. Delay (τ) in Propagation Systems

Propagation is **delay-governed** because seeds may:

- travel long distances  
- wait through transit phases  
- endure field variation  
- remain inactive until environment alignment  

## 3.1 Transit Delay

For airborne seeds:

$$
\tau_{\text{air}}
=
\frac{L_{\text{travel}}}
{v_{\text{wind}}}
$$

For water-dispersed seeds:

$$
\tau_{\text{water}}
=
\frac{L_{\text{travel}}}
{v_{\text{flow}}}
$$

For animal-dispersed seeds:

$$
\tau_{\text{animal}}
=
\text{gut-passage} + \text{detachment delay}
$$

## 3.2 Delay as Protection

Longer τ can increase survival by avoiding premature germination:

$$
\tau_{\text{prop}} \approx \tau_{\text{hib}}
$$

--- 

# 4. μ-Memory in Propagation Geometry

Seeds inherit μ-memory that shapes:

- shell reinforcement patterns  
- dispersal triggers  
- coat permeability  
- germination inhibitors  
- morphology favoring certain vectors (wind, animals, water)  

Define:

$$
\mu_{\text{prop}}
=
f(\text{lineage dispersal history},\;
\text{environment cycles},\;
\text{predation pressure})
$$

### 4.1 μ → Σ Propagation Rule

Across generations:

$$
\Sigma_{\text{prop},\,n+1}
=
\Sigma_{\text{prop},\,n}
+
\Delta\mu_{\text{prop}}
$$

---

# 5. Propagation Phase Fields (φ)

Propagation occurs in dynamic phase fields:

$$
\phi_{\text{prop}}(x,t)
=
F_{\text{air}}
+
F_{\text{water}}
+
F_{\text{soil}}
+
F_{\text{animal}}
$$

Seeds follow **minimum-resistance pathways**:

$$
\gamma(t)
=
\arg\min_{\gamma}
\int_{\gamma}
\phi_{\text{prop}} \; ds
$$

Propagation is fundamentally a phase-field navigation problem.

---

# 6. Transport Mechanisms & Delay Geometry

## 6.1 Airborne (Anemochory)

Air-dispersed seeds optimize for:

- low mass  
- high drag  
- rotational stabilization  

Terminal velocity:

$$
v_t
=
\sqrt{
\frac{2 m g}
{\rho A_{\text{drag}} C_d}
}
$$

Lower \( v_t \) → longer flight delay.

---

## 6.2 Animal Transport (Zoochory)

Animal dispersal uses:

- adhesive Σ-surfaces  
- barbed geometries  
- edible fruit with protected seeds  

Delay = ingestion + movement:

$$
\tau_{\text{zoo}}
=
\tau_{\text{gut}}
+
\tau_{\text{movement}}
$$

---

## 6.3 Water Transport (Hydrochory)

Seeds designed for water dispersal optimize:

- hydrophobic Σ-coats  
- buoyancy pockets  
- anti-rot structural stability  

Floating delay time:

$$
\tau_{\text{float}}
=
\frac{V_{\text{air}} - m/\rho_{\text{water}}}
{k_{\text{leak}}}
$$

---

## 6.4 Gravity-Based (Barochory)

Heavy seeds propagate via controlled fall:

$$
x(t)
=
\frac{1}{2}
g t^2
$$

Fall delay determines soil interface and impact pattern.

---

# 7. Germination Delay After Propagation

Seeds wait for environmental alignment:

$$
\tau_{\text{germ}}
=
\tau_{\text{water}} + \tau_{\text{thermal}} + \tau_{\text{ion}}
$$

Activation requires:

$$
\phi_{\text{env}}
\ge
\phi_{\text{threshold}}
$$

Propagation τ must complement germination τ.

---

# 8. Evolution of Seed Propagation Strategies

## 8.1 Optimization Equation

Seeds evolve propagation geometry to maximize survival:

$$
\Sigma_{\text{future}}
=
\arg\max_{\Sigma}
\left(
\eta_{\text{dispersal}}
+
\eta_{\text{survival}}
-
\Delta\tau_{\text{env}}
\right)
$$

## 8.2 Adaptive Strategy Shifts

Environmental changes drive:

- lighter seeds in windy ecosystems  
- buoyant seeds in floodplains  
- adhesive seeds in mammal-rich regions  
- reinforced seeds in fire-prone zones  

---

# 9. Integration with Other Botanical Tracks

### **Pollination Track**
Seed origin geometry depends on floral reproductive patterns.

### **Seed Geometry & Hibernation**
Propagation delay links to dormancy depth and coat construction.

### **Root Track**
Germination collapse defines initial Σ-root geometry after the propagation phase ends.

### **Photosynthesis Track**
Shoot development begins once propagation and germination collapse occur.

### **Identity Track**
Seed propagation preserves lineage identity across space and time.

---

# 10. Summary
Seed propagation is the Σ–τ–μ mechanism by which seeds:

- engage transport fields  
- protect identity during transit  
- coordinate propagation delay with germination delay  
- evolve geometry suited to environmental field structure  

Under UCC:

- **Σ** defines dispersal geometry  
- **τ** defines transit and activation timing  
- **μ** defines inherited dispersal memory  

Propagation is the bridge between lineage identity and environmental continuity.
