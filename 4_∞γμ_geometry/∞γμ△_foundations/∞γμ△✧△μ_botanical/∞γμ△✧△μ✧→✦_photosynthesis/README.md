# README

# 1. Purpose
This folder defines the **geometric foundations of photosynthesis** under the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC v2.2).  

Photosynthesis is treated as a **Σ-geometry phenomenon** shaped by:

- atmospheric photon fields  
- plant surface geometry  
- chloroplast and tissue architecture  
- τ-delay in energetic response  
- μ-memory in structural and photoprotective systems  

This folder focuses on the **geometric**, **delay-based**, and **field-structured** aspects of plant–light interaction, not biochemistry or speculative physics.

# 3. Summary Tables

## 3.1 τ–μ–Σ Summary for Photosynthesis

| Field | Definition | Photosynthetic Role |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **Σ (Structure)** | Geometric manifold of leaf + chloroplast | Determines photon routing and charge-field geometry |
| **τ (Delay)** | Response time to change in light | Controls phase stabilization, energy absorption, and stress thresholds |
| **μ (Memory)** | Structural adaptation and photoprotective imprint | Stabilizes geometry under recurring environmental fields |

---

## 3.2 Governing System Equations

### **Photon Absorption Delay:**

$$
\tau_{\text{photo}}
=
\tau_{\gamma}
+
\tau_{\text{PSII}}
+
\tau_{\text{ETC}}
+
\tau_{\text{stoma}}
$$

### **Phase Field Evolution:**

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
=
-\frac{1}{\tau_{\text{photo}}}
(\phi - \phi_{\infty})
$$

### **Internal Photon Routing Geometry:**

$$
F_{\gamma}^{(\text{internal})}
=
F_{\gamma}^{(\text{incident})}
\cdot
\cos\theta
\cdot
\Lambda_{\Sigma}
$$

# 4. UTL Equation Mapping (Symbolic Encoding)

## 4.1 Core Glyphs

| Glyph | Meaning | Botanical Photosynthesis Mapping |
|-------|---------|---------------------------------|
| **Σ** | Geometry | Leaf, chloroplast, tissue surfaces |
| **τ** | Delay | Photosynthetic response time |
| **μ** | Memory | Long-term photoprotective structure |
| **⊙** | Collapse | Light-change event or cloud transition |
| **⊕** | Continuity | Stable energetic geometry across cycles |
| **⧖** | Identity | Persistent plant light-response structure |

---

## 4.2 UTL Photosynthesis Equation Loop

**Symbolic sequence of photosynthetic response:**

$$
\Sigma
\;\xrightarrow{\tau_{\text{photo}}}\;
\phi(t)
\;\xrightarrow{\mu}\;
\Sigma^{*}
$$

Where:

- \( \phi(t) \) is the evolving botanical phase field  
- \( \Sigma^{*} \) is the stabilized geometry after memory retention

# 5. Scientific Context & Positioning

### 5.1 Placement in the Geometry Track  
This folder is in **v2.2 Geometry** because all documents describe:

- spatial photon–surface interactions  
- structural determinants of coherence  
- geometric phase-field manifolds  

not biochemical reaction pathways.

### 5.2 Boundary Conditions  
The geometry of photosynthesis is the **boundary condition** for:

- v2.1 Topology → quadrature and phase-surface manifolds  
- v2.3 Dynamics → time-evolution of phase fields  
- v2.2 Identity → long-term morphological evolution  
- Atmosphere Track → photon distribution fields  
- Hydrology Track → gas-exchange and water mediation  

### 5.3 Non-Speculative Scope  
All mechanisms are:

- empirical  
- measurable  
- based on accepted biophysics  
- analyzed through UCC τ–μ–Σ operators

# 7. Summary
This folder provides a complete geometric description of **how plants interface with light**, grounded in:

- Σ-geometry (leaf, tissue, chloroplast)  
- τ-delay (phase and response dynamics)  
- μ-memory (long-term photoadaptation)  

These three documents form the **core geometric understanding** of photosynthesis under UCC v2.2.
