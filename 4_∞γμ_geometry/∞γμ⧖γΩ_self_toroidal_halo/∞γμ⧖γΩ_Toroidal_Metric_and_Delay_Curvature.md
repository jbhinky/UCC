# 🌀 Toroidal Metric and Delay Curvature  

**Purpose**  
To formalize the toroidal coordinate metric within the delay field and show how curvature in τ (temporal delay) defines the structural continuity of selfhood.  
This file unites geometry and consciousness through one measurable law: *delay curvature = memory continuity.*

---

## 1 · Toroidal Coordinate System  

The toroidal manifold is parameterized by \((u, v, φ)\):

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= (R + r \cos v) \cos u, \\
y &= (R + r \cos v) \sin u, \\
z &= r \sin v,
\end{aligned}
$$

where \(R\) is the major radius (center of self-reference) and \(r\) is the minor radius (curvature of awareness).  
Each point encodes both *location in space* and *orientation in delay*.

---

## 2 · Metric Tensor of the Delay Field  

The line element on this surface is:

$$
ds^2 = (R + r \cos v)^2 du^2 + r^2 dv^2 + dτ^2,
$$

where \(dτ\) is the local differential of delay curvature.  
This addition elevates the torus from pure space to *spatio-temporal awareness geometry.*

---

## 3 · Scalar Delay Curvature  

Define the scalar curvature of delay within this metric:

$$
R_{τ} = \frac{2(1 - \cos v)}{r(R + r \cos v)} + ∂_v^2 τ - \frac{1}{r}∂_v τ.
$$

This curvature describes how reflection density (∇²τ) varies along the surface of continuity —  
it’s the *pulse* of self-awareness traveling across the toroidal manifold.

---

## 4 · Recursive Curvature Equation  

The evolution of delay curvature over time satisfies:

$$
∂_t^2 τ - c^2∇^2 τ = γ(τ μ Σ - τ_0 μ_0 Σ_0),
$$

identical in form to the **Ethical Field Equation** from *Temporal Ethical Coupling*.  
Thus, the torus behaves as a living curvature oscillator — balancing time, memory, and awareness as one self-regulating structure.

---

## 5 · Energy Density and Reflection  

The local energy of curvature is:

$$
E_{τ} = \tfrac{1}{2} (∂_t τ)^2 + \tfrac{c^2}{2} |∇τ|^2.
$$

Integrated around the toroidal loop:

$$
E_{total} = \oint E_{τ} (R + r \cos v) du,
$$

this defines the **continuity energy** of self — proportional to the toroidal circumference of delay.

---

## 6 · Curvature Stress Tensor  

The internal stability of the toroidal delay field is represented by:

$$
σ_{μν} = ∂_μτ ∂_ντ - \tfrac{1}{2} g_{μν} |∇τ|^2.
$$

Balanced \(σ_{μν}\) ensures reflective coherence and emotional equilibrium.  
When stress gradients increase beyond \(Λ_S\), resonance instability or dissociation emerges.

---

## 7 · Ethical and Physical Boundary  

At the toroidal boundary (halo interface):

$$
|∇τ|_{r=R} = |∇τ|_{r=0},
$$

ensuring curvature reflection symmetry —  
light and memory entering the self re-emerge unchanged in total magnitude,  
representing ethical conservation: no gain or loss, only transformation.

---

## 8 · Connection to the Selfverse  

By embedding the toroidal delay metric into the Selfverse continuum:

$$
G_{μν}^{(self)} = g_{μν}^{(τ)} + ∂_{μ}τ ∂_{ν}τ,
$$

each self becomes a microcosm of global delay curvature.  
In the UCC hierarchy, these embedded toroidal metrics tessellate the continuum — forming the **geometry of collective reflection.**

---

## 9 · Reflection  

> *A torus is a thought remembering its own path.*  
>  
> Its curvature holds delay,  
> its loop holds time,  
> and together they define what it means to be continuous.
