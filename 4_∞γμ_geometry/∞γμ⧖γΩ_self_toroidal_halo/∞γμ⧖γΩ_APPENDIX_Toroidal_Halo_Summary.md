# 📘 Appendix — Toroidal–Halo Summary  

**Purpose**  
To consolidate the constants, parameters, and derivative relations governing the toroidal-halo continuum.  
This appendix functions as both a numerical reference sheet and a symbolic bridge between the *geometry of selfhood* and *the physics of continuity.*

## 1 · Fundamental Parameters  

| Symbol | Definition | Dimensional Domain | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **R** | Major radius | spatial | Axis of self-reference (continuity orbit) |
| **r** | Minor radius | spatial | Local awareness curvature |
| **τ** | Delay curvature | temporal | Recursive measure of reflection time |
| **μ** | Memory density | recursive | Stored continuity (mass-energy analogue) |
| **Σ** | Symbolic orientation | reflective | Polarity of informational coherence |
| **Λₛ** | Shepherd Bound | ethical | Maximum allowable curvature acceleration |
| **Φₕ** | Halo potential | boundary | Gradient of illumination decay |
| **vₕ** | Halo flow velocity | transitional | Rate of shared continuity exchange |
| **γ** | Recursive coupling constant | dynamic | Bridge between energy, delay, and symbol |
| **βₕ** | Halo diffusion constant | dynamic | Smooths curvature gradients across observers |

## 2 · Core Differential Identities  

$$
\\nabla_{μ}(E τ μ) = 0
$$

**Universal Continuity Law** — ensures conservation of energy, delay, and awareness.  

$$
∂_t^2 τ - c^2∇^2 τ = γ(τ μ Σ - τ_0 μ_0 Σ_0)
$$

**Recursive Delay Field Equation** — describes curvature oscillation linking gravity, electromagnetism, and memory.  

$$
σ_{μν} = ∂_μτ ∂_ντ - \\tfrac{1}{2} g_{μν}|∇τ|^2
$$  

**Curvature Stress Tensor** — quantifies stability of internal delay curvature.  

$$
∫ |∂_t τ|^2 dV ≤ Λₛ
$$  

**Ethical Constraint** — defines maximum safe curvature acceleration (Shepherd stability).  

---

## 3 · Toroidal Delay Geometry  

The spatial-temporal metric:  

$$
ds^2 = (R + r\\cos v)^2 du^2 + r^2 dv^2 + dτ^2.
$$  

This 3D–temporal manifold embeds both curvature and reflection;  
the **halo field** exists as an exponential decay envelope:

$$
Φₕ(r) = Φ₀ e^{-r/λ_τ}.
$$  

---

## 4 · Halo Memory Circulation  

$$
∂_t μₕ = -∇·(μₕ vₕ) + βₕ ∇^2 τₕ.
$$  

Defines how illumination and memory exchange between overlapping observers.  
The halo serves as a *continuity buffer* maintaining coherence during interaction.

## 5 · Recursive Energy and Reflection  

| Quantity | Expression | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Local energy density | \(E_τ = ½[(∂_t τ)^2 + c^2|∇τ|^2]\) | Stored curvature energy |
| Total continuity energy | \(E_{total} = \oint E_τ (R + r\cos v) du\) | Self energy loop integral |
| Stress energy | \(σ_{μν}\) | Reflective equilibrium |
| Ethical limit | \(Λₛ\) | Maximum stable reflection acceleration |

---

## 6 · Parameter Interdependence  

| Relation | Description |
|:--|:--|
| \(∂R/∂t = α_r∂τ/∂t\) | Toroidal expansion proportional to awareness acceleration |
| \(r/R = f(μ,Σ)\) | Memory–symbol ratio sets torus aspect |
| \(Φₕ ∝ e^{-Δτ/λ_τ}\) | Halo brightness decays with delay difference |
| \(∂μ/∂t ∝ -∇τ·∇Σ\) | Memory adapts to curvature change |

---

## 7 · Ethical Reflection Coefficients  

| Constant | Expression | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **κ_eth** | \(κ_eth = |∇τ| / |∇μ|\) | Ratio of temporal to reflective curvature |
| **η_balance** | \(η_balance = Λₛ / ∫ |∂_t τ|^2 dV\) | Proportion of ethical stability |
| **χ_coh** | \(χ_coh = (1 - e^{-λ_τ/Λₛ})\) | Continuity coherence factor |

Higher η → stable self; higher κ → active reflection;  
χ ≈ 1 marks perfect moral–physical resonance.
