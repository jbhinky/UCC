# ✦ UCC Geometry  
### **Recursive Geometry of Delay (τ), Memory (μ), and Identity (⧖)**  

This directory defines the **geometric layer** of the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).  
Where **Topology (Σγ)** defines the *rules of structure*,  
**Geometry (rμ)** defines the *shape* of those structures.

This corpus unifies:

- **delay curvature geometry** (τ)
- **memory density geometry** (μ)
- **self-recursion geometry** (⧖)
- **toroidal identity halos**
- **recursive hyperspheres**
- **emotional–energetic RBGE color-gravity mapping**
- **continuity bridges** through Υ-structure

Together, these form the **rμ-layer**:  
> The geometry of *remembered continuity.*

---

# 1 · Purpose of the Geometry Layer

Geometry is the domain in which continuity becomes **visual**, **spatial**, and **measurable**.

It defines:

- the **surfaces** generated by delay curvature  
- the **shapes** generated by μ-density  
- the **identity structures** generated by ⧖ recursion  
- the **color-gravity relationships** in RBGE mapping  
- the **toroid–hypersphere duality** of selfhood  
- the **bridging surfaces** that preserve unity (Υ)

Where curvature describes *how reality bends*,  
geometry describes *what that bending looks like.*

# 3 · Core Geometric Equations

### 3.1 — Delay Curvature Surface
The fundamental geometric form:

$$
\nabla^{2}\tau = \kappa\,\gamma
$$

This generates:

- curved delay surfaces  
- continuity-resistant shells  
- the geometric seed of all LD-level shapes

---

### 3.2 — Memory Density Field

$$
\frac{\partial μ}{\partial t}
= -\nabla\!\cdot(\, μ \nabla\tau \,)
$$

This defines:

- memory clustering  
- recursive binding  
- surface weighting  
- identity-locking geometry

---

### 3.3 — Self-Geometry Equation

The geometric expansion of the Self Equation:

$$
⧖(x) = (A ∪ C)\big[\,τ(x) + Σ(x) + μ(x)\,\big]
$$

Selfhood appears as a **field geometry**,  
not just an abstract operator.

This leads naturally to:

- **toroidal identity halos**
- **recursive hyperspheres**
- **stable γ-shells**
- **RBGE (color-gravity) encoding**

---

# 4 · Sub-Corpus Summaries

## ∞γμ⍝⋑_rbgie_gravity_mapping/
Defines the **RBGE hypersphere**, mapping emotional color space (RBGie)  
into **gravitational delay geometry**.  
A complete framework linking:

- photonic spectrum  
- memory density  
- delay curvature  
- emotional/experiential state  

The equation:

$$
G_{\mathrm{RBGE}}(x) = μ(x)\,∇τ(x)\,C_{\mathrm{rgbie}}(x)
$$

---

## ∞γμ△_foundations/
Primary geometric definitions:

- rμ-manifold  
- continuity surfaces  
- toroidal & hyperspherical geometry  
- γ-invariant curvature mapping

---

## ∞γμ✧†✦_ethics_&_interfaith/
Shepherd-aligned ethics expressed geometrically:

- continuity of identity  
- μ-preservation  
- non-distortion of surfaces  
- sacred geometry derived from the Self Equation

---

## ∞γμ⧖γΩ_self_toroidal_halo/
Geometry of the **Self-Toroid**:

- inner torus of μ-memory  
- outer torus of τ-delay  
- γ-shell stabilizing selfhood across recursion

Canonical generating function:

$$
R_{\mathrm{self}} = μτ + γ
$$

---

## ∞γμλγ⍝_self_hypersphere/
Defines the **LD-recursive hypersphere** of identity.

Selfhood appears as:

- recursive hypersurface  
- dynamically expanding LD-shell  
- continuity-preserving bubble in γ-space

Equation:

$$
r_{\mathrm{LD}}(n) = \sqrt{γ_{n} μ_{n}}
$$

---

## ∞γμυ_bridges/
All Υ-bridges (upsilon bridges) that join:

- toroidal ↔ hyperspherical structures  
- μ-shells ↔ τ-surfaces  
- identity ↔ continuity  
- recursive LD layers

The bridge law:

$$
Υ = ∇τ \cdot μ
$$

Geometry is the layer at which all other frameworks become *visible*.

# 6 · The Closed Geometric Statement

Everything in this directory is built on one invariant:

$$
\boxed{
Geometry = τ\text{ curvature} + μ\text{ binding} + γ\text{ stability}
}
$$

or equivalently:

$$
\boxed{
\text{Shape of Reality} = \text{Shape of Memory Across Delay}
}
$$

This is the **heart** of the geometry layer in UCC v2.5.0.
