# ∞γμ⌱ — LD Geometry
**Lane:** **LD** (local-domain mechanics).  
**Constraint:** **No Latin `Y`. Only `Յ` is universal admissibility (declared upstream).**  
LD Geometry defines the **local geometric structure** that makes the operator chain measurable.

---

## 1) What LD Geometry covers
LD Geometry specifies:
- **local axes (⌱)** and **local lattice (⤢)** when required,
- **periodicity (π)** for cyclic domains,
- the placement of the **operator chain** within declared structure,
- how **distortion (∇)** and **stability (⍝)** are represented geometrically,
- when **scale (λ)** and **coupling (γ)** must be attached.

---

## 2) Canonical LD operator chain (with mandatory remembered light)
**Remembered / curved light (✦) is required before collapse.**

$$
✧ \xrightarrow{\tau} \Sigma \xrightarrow{\mu} ✦ \xrightarrow{\,⊙\,} \xrightarrow{\,⊕\,}
$$

- ✧ is the substrate token in LD.
- τ, Σ, μ are operators.
- ✦ is the **integrated/remembered state** (non-skippable).
- ⊙ commits.
- ⊕ chains continuity (LD→LDF/LDSF/LC bridges).

---

## 3) Locality declarations (geometry prerequisites)

### 3.1 Axis declaration (⌱)
A geometric statement is only valid if axes are declared:

$$
\boxed{⌱}\ \text{declared}
$$

### 3.2 Lattice declaration (⤢)
A locality statement (position, neighborhood, boundary) requires:

$$
\boxed{⤢}\ \text{declared}
$$

### 3.3 Periodicity (π)
If the domain is cyclic:

$$
\boxed{\pi}\ \text{declared}
$$

---

## 4) Distortion geometry (∇) and integrity (△)
∇ is the LD diagnostic marker for:
- misalignment,
- uncertainty gradient,
- curvature instability,
- measurement deviation.

$$
∇ \ \text{is measured/declared in LD}
$$

Integrity (△) is not a physics operator, but may be attached as a constraint discipline:

$$
△(\∇)\ \text{bounds release conditions}
$$

---

## 5) Stability marker (⍝)
⍝ marks that a state is **stabilized enough** to be eligible for commitment (⊙).

$$
✦ \xrightarrow{\text{stabilize}} ⍝ \xrightarrow{⊙}
$$

⍝ is not causality; it is a stability flag.

---

## 6) Cross-scale and cross-domain attachments (λ, γ)
LD Geometry must remain auditable:

### Scale attachment
$$
(\text{cross-scale}) \Rightarrow \lambda\ \text{declared}
$$

### Coupling attachment
$$
(\text{cross-domain}) \Rightarrow \gamma\ \text{declared}
$$

---

## 7) Global field contexts (Ω) inside LD
Ω can appear in LD only as a **global field-layer context** (still non-ethical):

$$
Ω \ \text{declares a coherent global field-layer context}
$$

Ω is not universal and not governance.

---

## 8) Minimal LD Geometry template (ready for reuse)
When writing a new LD geometry statement, use:

1) Declare ⌱ (and ⤢ if locality matters)
2) Declare π only if cyclic
3) Attach λ/γ if scaling/mapping occurs
4) Run the chain:
   - ✧ → τ → Σ → μ → ✦ → ⍝ → ⊙ → ⊕
5) Mark ∇ if distortion is observed
