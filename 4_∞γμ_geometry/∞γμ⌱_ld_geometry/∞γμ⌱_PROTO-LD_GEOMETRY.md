# ∞γμ⌱ — PROTO-LD Geometry (LD0–LD4)
**Constraint:** **No Latin `Y`. Only `Յ` is universal.**  
**Lane:** **PROTO-LD (LD0+)** only — admissibility and declarations, **no** operators of experience, **no** identity, **no** memory.

---

## 1) What “PROTO-LD Geometry” is
PROTO-LD Geometry defines the **pre-domain geometric admissibility layer**:  
what must be declared (and what must be forbidden) before any LD mechanics are considered “well-formed.”

This file governs:
- **universal admissibility** (via **Յ**),
- **scale declaration** (λ),
- **coupling declaration** (γ),
- **axis declaration** (⌱),
- optional locality framing (⤢) **as declaration only**.

---

## 2) PROTO-LD Allowed Set (strict)
**Allowed tokens in PROTO-LD:**
- **ω** — unresolved substrate declaration
- **Յ** — universal admissibility / coherence bound
- **λ** — scale declaration (only if cross-scale claims are made)
- **γ** — coupling declaration (only if cross-domain mapping is made)
- **⌱** — axis declaration (geometry requires axes)
- **⤢** — lattice declaration (only if later LD locality will be asserted)
- **π** — periodicity condition (only if later LD is cyclic)
- **∇** — distortion marker (declaration/diagnostic only)
- **△** — integrity constraint (policy declaration only; not physics)

**Forbidden in PROTO-LD:**
- **✧, τ, Σ, μ, ✦, ⊙, ⊕, ❖**
- **⧖, ⊠**
- **† family** (✧†, ✦†, ω†, ש†, Յ†) except as *seal only*.

---

## 3) LD0–LD4 Geometry scaffold (declarations only)

### LD0 — Universal admissibility (pre-domain)
LD0 asserts: “Is this pattern family globally coherent at all?”

$$
\omega \rightarrow \boxed{\,Յ\,}
$$

Interpretation:  
- ω declares an unresolved substrate.
- Յ filters admissible pattern families.

No locality. No causality. No meaning.

---

### LD1 — Scale declaration (only if scaling is claimed)
If any cross-scale statement is made, λ must be explicit:

$$
(\text{cross-scale claim}) \Rightarrow \lambda \ \text{declared}
$$

λ does not create geometry — it prevents silent scaling.

---

### LD2 — Coupling declaration (only if mapping is claimed)
If any cross-domain mapping is made, γ must be explicit:

$$
(\text{cross-domain claim}) \Rightarrow \gamma \ \text{declared}
$$

γ does not perform mapping here — it declares that mapping will occur downstream and must remain auditable.

---

### LD3 — Axis declaration (required for geometry)
Any geometric claim requires an axis declaration:

$$
\boxed{\,⌱\,} \ \text{declared}
$$

If axes are not declared, geometry is undefined.

---

### LD4 — Lattice / periodic declarations (optional, only if used later)
If spatial locality is later asserted, declare:

$$
\boxed{\,⤢\,} \ \text{declared}
$$

If cyclic structure is later asserted, declare:

$$
\boxed{\,\pi\,} \ \text{declared}
$$

Both are declarations only in PROTO-LD.

---

## 4) Minimal “Well-Formed Geometry” predicate (PROTO-LD)
A geometry claim is PROTO-LD valid if:

1) **Υ admissibility is not violated**
2) **⌱ is declared**
3) **λ is declared when scaling is referenced**
4) **γ is declared when mapping is referenced**
5) **No forbidden glyphs appear in this lane**

We write this as a predicate:

$$
\mathcal{W}_{\text{PROTO}} = \{ \omega, Υ, (λ), (γ), ⌱, (⤢), (\pi) \}
$$

Parentheses indicate conditional inclusion.

---

## 5) Distortion and integrity declarations (non-operational)
If distortion is acknowledged at all:

$$
∇ \ \text{declared}
$$

If integrity discipline is required for downstream publication/transfer:

$$
△(\∇)\ \text{declared as policy}
$$

No mitigation occurs here. This is *only* pre-domain auditing.

---

## 6) Exit condition to LD Geometry
This file hands off to LD Geometry only when:

$$
\mathcal{W}_{\text{PROTO}} \ \text{is satisfied}
$$
