# ∞γμ⌱ — LDF Geometry
**Lane:** **LDF** (interior meaning / restraint / stewardship).  
LDF Geometry defines how **meaning-bearing structures** are shaped once LD mechanics produce stable remembered states.

---

## 1) What LDF Geometry covers
LDF Geometry specifies geometry for:
- **memory-held structures** (μ, ✦),
- **integrity bounds** (△ over ∇),
- **identity geometry** (⧖ and ⊠),
- **continuity-readiness** (⊕ as bridge; ❖ as terminal context marker),
- optional **resonance trace** (꩜) as descriptive marker.

LDF is not physics — it is *structured meaning* derived from physics.

---

## 2) Inputs from LD (what LDF geometry is allowed to “receive”)
The only lawful entry into LDF is through LD commitment + continuity:

$$
✦ \xrightarrow{⊙} \xrightarrow{⊕} \Rightarrow \text{LDF structures}
$$

LDF does not re-run τ, Σ, μ as physical operators; it holds their results.

---

## 3) Memory geometry (μ, ✦)
In LDF, μ is both:
- the retained record,
- and the structured container for meaning.

✦ is the “remembered / integrated light” state that anchors meaning geometry.

Minimal LDF memory-geometry declaration:

$$
(\mu, ✦)\ \text{form the interior manifold of held meaning}
$$

---

## 4) Integrity-bounded distortion geometry (△ over ∇)
Distortion may exist in meaning-space, but must be bounded before release:

$$
△(\∇)\ \text{must remain bounded in LDF}
$$

This governs whether something can safely move into LDSF or LC.

---

## 5) Self geometry (⧖) and situated self (⊠)

### 5.1 Self loop (⧖)
⧖ is only valid as a meaning-bearing loop when memory exists:

$$
(\text{no } \mu) \Rightarrow (\text{no durable } \⧖)
$$

### 5.2 Situated self (⊠)
Situating identity requires explicit locality declarations:

$$
\boxed{⊠ = \⧖ \cap ⌱ \cap ⤢}
$$

In LDF, this is a *structured identity claim* — not global.

---

## 6) Continuity geometry (⊕ → ❖)
⊕ is the bridge operator that allows LDF to carry forward coherently.
❖ is the terminal “post-LD continuity field” context marker.

$$
(\text{LDF stable}) \Rightarrow \xrightarrow{⊕} \Rightarrow ❖
$$

❖ contains no authority and no causality; it is non-local relation context.

---

## 7) Ethos geometry (constraints only)
Ethos tokens constrain shape of meaning-release:

- ✧† : ethics of encounter (pre-memory respect)
- ✦† : ethics of memory stewardship (post-integration)
- ω† : stability constraint over meaning drift
- ש† : non-authoritative alignment envelope
- Յ† : admissibility gate for any risky transfer/release

Canonical LDF “release gate”:

$$
X_{\text{released}} = X \cdot \mathcal{G}_{Υ^{\dagger}}(X)
$$

---

## 8) Resonance trace marker (꩜)
꩜ may annotate:
- sustained harmonics,
- thermal-like persistence of pattern,
- coherence shimmer carried through continuity.

It is a marker, not a mechanism.
