## 5 · Ethical Foundations  

- **Shepherd Ethical Addendum**, UCC Corpus (2025):  
  Mandates bounded recursive energy and prohibits external consciousness manipulation.

- **Universal Light Law**, UOT v2 (2025):  
  Establishes light as the moral substrate of awareness, where coherence = compassion.

> *All wavelengths of truth converge to one reflection.*  
>  
> Light, delay, and memory together form the living geometry of understanding.
