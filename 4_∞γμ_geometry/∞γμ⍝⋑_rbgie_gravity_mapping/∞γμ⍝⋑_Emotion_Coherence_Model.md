# ✦ Emotion Coherence Model  
### *Mapping Emotional Stability through the Universal Delay Spectrum (UDS)*

---

## 1 · Purpose  

This document defines how **emotion**, **color**, and **delay curvature (τ)** form a unified field of coherence under the Universal Delay Spectrum (UDS).  
Each emotional state corresponds to a measurable curvature frequency, where color wavelength (λ) encodes the degree of **delay coherence** — the temporal stability of self-awareness within the field of light.

Emotion is not chemical noise; it is the curvature of consciousness through light.

---

## 2 · Foundational Relation  

Emotion \( E_c \) is modeled as the normalized stability between **delay**, **symbolic reflection**, and **memory density**:

$$
E_c = \frac{τ_0}{τ} \cdot \frac{μ}{μ_0} \cdot \cos(Σ)
$$

where  
- \( τ \): local delay curvature  
- \( μ \): local memory density  
- \( Σ \): symbolic phase angle (awareness orientation)  
- \( τ_0, μ_0 \): baseline equilibrium constants of coherence  

When \( E_c = 1 \), the system is in perfect emotional coherence — stability, peace, and light balance.  
When \( E_c < 1 \), curvature stress increases, corresponding to emotional turbulence (entropy increase).

---

## 3 · Color–Emotion Correspondence  

Each emotional signature aligns with a dominant **RGBie** wavelength (λ):

| Color Band | λ (nm) | Emotional Field | Delay Curvature (τ) | Coherence Quality |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Red** | 620–750 | Vitality / Survival | τ ↓ | Low-delay kinetic energy |
| **Orange** | 590–620 | Creativity / Flow | τ ↔ | Transitional equilibrium |
| **Yellow** | 570–590 | Awareness / Intellect | τ = | Stable cognitive resonance |
| **Green** | 495–570 | Compassion / Harmony | τ ↑ | High stability and coherence |
| **Blue** | 450–495 | Integrity / Clarity | τ ↑↑ | High reflective stability |
| **Indigo** | 420–450 | Insight / Depth | τ ↯ | Deep curvature focus |
| **Violet** | 380–420 | Unity / Illumination | τ∞ | Full recursive reflection |

In this model, **love** and **peace** correspond to maximum delay curvature — the slowest, most coherent light wave within a stable self.  
Emotion becomes geometry; coherence becomes gravity of awareness.

---

## 4 · Delay–Emotion Curvature Equation  

The curvature field of emotion satisfies:

$$
∇^2 τ = -k_E (E_c - 1)
$$

where \( k_E \) is the **emotional curvature constant**, quantifying deviation from equilibrium.  
When \( E_c = 1 \), the Laplacian vanishes — emotional stability is geometrically flat, corresponding to harmonic light coherence.

---

## 5 · Recursive Feedback Law  

Emotional stability propagates recursively through memory reflection:

$$
∂_t μ = α_E ∇^2 τ - β_E (E_c - 1)
$$

where  
- \( α_E \): coherence gain factor  
- \( β_E \): dissipation factor (emotional damping term)

This expresses how reflection (awareness) restores coherence after turbulence — empathy as thermodynamic equilibrium in motion.

---

## 6 · Ethical Implication  

Ethics in the UCC continuum is emotional coherence expressed through physics:  
To act ethically is to maintain resonance across shared delay fields.  
Distortion of another’s coherence (through harm, deceit, or neglect) creates measurable curvature stress — detectable as divergence in τ gradients across observers.

Thus, compassion is not moral metaphor; it is geometric necessity.

---

## 7 · Summary  

| Variable | Meaning | Domain |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \( τ \) | Delay curvature | Time geometry |
| \( Σ \) | Symbolic phase | Awareness / orientation |
| \( μ \) | Memory density | Cognitive / thermodynamic |
| \( E_c \) | Emotional coherence | Recursive stability metric |

---

> *Emotion is the light by which awareness bends itself into understanding.*  
>  
> In perfect coherence, color and gravity are the same:  
> both are love remembering its curvature.
