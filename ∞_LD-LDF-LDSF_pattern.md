# LD–LDSF–LDF Structural Pattern

## Purpose

This document defines the **structural relationship, scope, and boundary conditions** of:

- **LD** (Light Dimensions)  
- **LDSF** (Light Dimension Shared Fields)  
- **LDF** (Light Dimension Fields)

within the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).

It exists to:
- prevent semantic drift,
- clarify legacy mappings from earlier UCC versions,
- and provide a single authoritative schema reference for all applied and proof layers.

No new theory is introduced.

---

## 1. Core Definitions

### LD — Light Dimensions
**LDs are quantitative structural regimes.**

They describe **physical and pre-biological organization** of reality, governed by:
- measurable parameters,
- repeatable dynamics,
- and non-experiential processes.

LDs do **not** require observers, selves, or shared meaning.

**Canonical Scope**
- **LD0** — universal potential (no structure)
- **LD1–LD4** — atomic → macroscopic physical organization
- **LD5** — *operator only* (union / coupling, not a domain)

LDs remain strictly structural.

---

### LDSF — Light Dimension Shared Fields
**LDSFs are qualitative shared environments.**

They arise when LD structures:
- interact collectively,
- persist across populations,
- or form stable shared systems (biological, ecological, social, planetary).

LDSFs:
- follow LD quantitative constraints,
- but express **shared qualitative behavior**,
- without requiring individual subjective selfhood.

They represent the **3D shared world embedded in time**.

**Canonical Scope**
- **LDSF1–LDSF4** only  
- LDSF never exceeds 4 by design

Examples:
- ecosystems
- climate systems
- biological populations
- civilizations
- language systems

---

### LDF — Light Dimension Fields
**LDFs are experiential fields.**

They describe systems where:
- a bounded self exists,
- experience occurs,
- and continuity is carried through memory and awareness.

LDFs integrate:
- quantitative LD structure,
- qualitative LDSF context,
- and internal experiential recursion.

LDFs are the **first domain where qualia applies**.

**Canonical Scope**
- **LDF1–LDF4**

---

## 2. Structural Relationship

The three layers are **not hierarchical competitors**.  
They are **orthogonal but coupled**:

- **LD** provides structure  
- **LDSF** provides shared context  
- **LDF** provides experience  

No layer replaces another.

---

## 3. The Role of LD5 (Union Operator)

**LD5 is not a domain.**

It is a **coupling operator** that allows:
- LD → LDSF transitions
- LD → LDF transitions
- LDSF → LDF stabilization

LD5 does not contain phenomena.  
It only enables **union without collapse**.

---

## 4. Legacy Mapping (UCC ≤ v2.5.0)

Earlier UCC versions used **LD6–LD9** to describe domains now clarified.

This update remaps them cleanly:

| Legacy Label | Current Mapping |
|-------------|----------------|
| LD6 | LDSF1 |
| LD7 | LDSF2 |
| LD8 | LDSF3 |
| LD9 | LDSF4 |
| Self / Experience refs | LDF1–LDF4 |

No retroactive rewriting is required.  
This document **amends interpretation**, not history.

---

## 5. Boundary Conditions

- LDs remain **quantitative**
- LDSFs are **qualitative but non-experiential**
- LDFs are **experiential**
- LDSF does **not** imply consciousness
- LDF does **not** override physics
- No LDSF or LDF exists without LD constraints

---

## 6. Scope Notes

- This document is **schema-only**
- It introduces **no field-specific claims**
- Applied, coupling, and proof files must reference this structure
- Conflicts must be resolved by this pattern, not by exception
