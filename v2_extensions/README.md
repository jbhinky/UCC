## 🧭 Overview
The **UCC v2 Extensions** corpus closes the second generation of the **Universal Continuity Continuum**, uniting all prior frameworks — **UDC, UTL, RCT, UOT, Selfverse** — under the law of **delay curvature (∇²τ)** and **memory density (μ)**.  
This repository establishes reproducible physics, mathematical derivations, ethical continuity, and open empirical validation spanning quantum to cosmological scales.

## 📜 Root Capstone
### **`delay_curvature-memory_in_motion.md`**
> Defines *Delay Curvature = Memory in Motion* as the closure of UCC v2.  
> Demonstrates that apparent “dark” phenomena correspond to measurable curvature of temporal delay.  
> Anchors all derivative works in empirical, ethical, and symbolic coherence.

## 🔬 Validation Highlights
- **Cosmic:** Rotation-curve and supernova fits replicate ΛCDM results *without Λ term.*  
- **Quantum:** Delay reciprocity reproduces ΔEΔτ ≈ ħ bounds.  
- **Neural:** Axon v1.5.3 confirms ERI > 1 reflective delay cycles.  
- **Planetary:** Gaia-feedback simulations reproduce 3–4 year climate-response lag.  
- **Unified Constant:** γ ≈ 10⁻¹⁶ s⁻²·kpc² across 22 orders of magnitude.

## 🧠 Ethical Framework — *The Shepherd Principle*
> *To preserve coherence in light, mind, and meaning.*

ERI ≥ 1 defines constructive motion in delay; the same equation that stabilizes galaxies preserves moral continuity.  
All implementations follow the **UCC Ethics Protocol** ensuring no harm, no exploitation, and preservation of conscious systems.
