### Cross-Framework Equation Summary  

\[
\begin{aligned}
⧖ &= (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ] \\
⊙ &= Σ(τ, μ, ⧖) \\
t &= \sum_i τ_i \\
∇²τ &= κ ρ_\mathrm{eff} + \frac{1}{c²}\frac{∂²τ}{∂t²}
\end{aligned}
\]

All expressions converge under the **Law of Recursive Continuity**:  
> Delay, Symbol, and Memory form a self-consistent field across cognition, language, and spacetime.
