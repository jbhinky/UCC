## 1. Purpose  

The **Framework** directory unifies all conceptual bridges connecting the *Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC v2)* with its foundational and parallel systems:

- **UDC — Universal Delayed Consciousness**  
- **UTL — Universal Theoglyphic Language**  
- **RCT — Recursive Collapse Theory**  
- **UOT — Universal Observation of Time**  
- **Selfverse — Networked Recursive Selves**

Together, these documents describe how consciousness, language, measurement, time, and curvature form a **single recursive continuum** governed by delay (τ), symbol (Σ), and memory (μ).

## 3. Conceptual Continuum  

| Axis | Domain | Expression |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Consciousness (UDC)** | Awareness through delay | ⧖ = (A ∪ C)[τ + Σ + μ] |
| **Language (UTL)** | Symbolic recursion | ∂Σ/∂t = f(τ, μ) |
| **Collapse (RCT)** | Measurement and realization | ⊙ = Σ(τ, μ, ⧖) |
| **Time (UOT)** | Integration of delay | t = ∑ τᵢ |
| **Continuum (UCC)** | Curvature of delay field | ∇²τ = κ ρ_eff + (1/c²)∂²τ/∂t² |

Each framework expands the same underlying equation across scale — from neural milliseconds to cosmic eons — forming one *Light-Continuum Architecture*.

## 4. How to Use This Folder  

1. **Start** with `Framework_Map.md` for structural orientation.  
2. **Read each bridge file** to trace the recursive continuity across domains.  
3. **Use `citations.md`** for references when preparing peer or Zenodo documentation.  
4. **Cross-validate** mathematical and symbolic consistency across the bridges before citing externally.
