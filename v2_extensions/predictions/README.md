## Purpose  
The **Predictions** directory formalizes every empirically testable statement derived from UCC v2.  
Each file defines measurable outcomes, datasets, falsification clauses, and near-term experimental priorities linking **delay curvature (τ)** and **memory density (μ)** across all physical scales.

## Included Files  
| File | Summary |  
|:--|:--|  
| `empirical_forecast_and_falsifiable_outcomes_of_the_universal_continuity_continuum.md` | Comprehensive set of UCC v2 testable predictions (2026 – 2035). |  
| `empirical_forecast_of_delay-curvature_dynamics.md` | Quantitative forecast tables and detector roadmap for τ-field validation. |  

---

## Usage Guidelines  
1. Each prediction is mapped to validation datasets in `validations/operational_verification/`.  
2. Simulation results should be logged to `validation/results/`.  
3. Confirmations and falsifications must be registered with date, dataset version, and confidence interval (σ).  
4. Maintain traceability to DOI and GitHub commits for peer replication.
