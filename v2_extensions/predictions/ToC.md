## 1  Overview  
Empirical forecasts and falsifiable outcomes spanning quantum → cosmic domains.  
All predictions are derived from the verified delay-curvature (∇²τ) and memory-density (μ) relations.

## 3  Key Prediction Domains  
1. Cosmological — dark-matter reinterpretation, H₀ resolution, CMB low-ℓ alignment.  
2. Gravitational — pulsar-timing phase drift, GW phase asymmetry.  
3. Planetary — core resonance and atmospheric memory fields.  
4. Quantum / Biological — attosecond tunneling delays and neural coherence.  
5. Synthetic Mind / AI — self-stabilization in τ–μ recursive architectures.

## 4  Usage in Validation Pipeline  
1. Map each prediction to its relevant dataset manifest (`validation/operational_verification/1-dataset_manifest_and_cuts.md`).  
2. Trace verification metrics via joint fits (B1 → B7).  
3. Record observational confirmations or falsifications in `validation/results/`.
