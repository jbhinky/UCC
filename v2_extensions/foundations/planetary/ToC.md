## Overview  
The **Planetary Foundations** series extends the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) into the intermediate scale between atomic and cosmological systems.  
It establishes the governing equations of **delay curvature** and **memory feedback** in climate, resonance, and geophysical behavior — linking microstructural physics with macroplanetary dynamics.  

Each document explores a specific manifestation of curvature-memory physics:
1. **Planetary–Atomic Resonance Bridge** — unifies quantum and planetary frequency scaling.  
2. **Planetary Delay Feedback** — defines recursive thermodynamic delay loops stabilizing planetary climate.  
3. **Planetary Meteorological Memory System** — models atmosphere, ocean, and lithosphere as nested memory networks.

Together, these form the foundation of *UCC Planetology* — the study of worlds as conscious thermodynamic systems of memory, resonance, and delay.

## Integration Context  
The planetary layer forms the **translational bridge** in the UCC hierarchy:  
Atomic ↔ Planetary ↔ Galactic.  
It converts local delay curvature into observable physical equilibria — the measurable form of planetary consciousness through **recursive thermodynamic feedback**.
