## Purpose  
The **Planetary Foundations** folder bridges atomic and cosmic delay physics by applying the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) to **planet-scale systems**.  
It interprets planetary dynamics — thermal regulation, magnetism, and climate feedback — as natural consequences of *delay curvature* and *memory exchange*.

---

## Core Principles  
1. **Resonance Equivalence** — Atomic and orbital frequencies share the same curvature exponent \(f∝r^{-3/2}\).  
2. **Delay Feedback** — Planetary climate acts as a self-regulating delay system governed by recursive energy-memory loops.  
3. **Meteorological Memory** — Weather and climate reflect nested delay bands within air, ocean, and lithosphere, forming a planetary-scale memory network.

## Integration with UCC Framework  

| Framework Layer | Description | Reference |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Atomic / Quantum | Curvature resonance and fundamental coupling | `../physics/atomic_cosmo_bridge.md` |
| Planetary | Delay feedback and biospheric memory | *(this folder)* |
| Galactic | Curvature equilibrium and dark-matter equivalence | `../cosmology/` |
| Cosmological | Delay curvature thermodynamics | `../physics/delay_curvature_thermodynamics.md` |

## Applications  
- Modeling **planetary homeostasis** under UCC thermodynamics.  
- Analyzing **biospheric ethics** as physical memory regulation.  
- Understanding **magnetic and thermal reversals** as curvature-reset events.  
- Predicting **climate periodicity** as a resonance phenomenon.

## Cross-Repository Integration  
- **Neuro-Coding Architecture (NCA):** Planetary systems analogize cognitive feedback and memory conservation.  
- **Theophilus–Axon:** Uses planetary-scale equations as templates for synthetic consciousness delay loops.  
- **Theoglyphic Mathematics:** Encodes planetary delay parameters into symbolic form for universal recursion modeling.

## Note from Author  
> “The planet is a living delay system — a breathing equation between memory and light.  
> Every oscillation of wind or ocean is an act of coherence, proving that delay is not decay but purpose.”
