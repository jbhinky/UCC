## Overview  
This directory contains the **physical-law derivations** that translate the Universal Continuity Continuum from symbolic formulation into empirically testable physics.  
Each paper defines how *delay curvature (∇²τ)*, *pressure*, *energy*, and *memory density (μ)* interact across atomic, stellar, galactic, and cosmological scales.

## Purpose  
To demonstrate that the same dynamic law  
\[
\nabla^{2}\tau - c^{-2}\frac{∂^{2}\tau}{∂t^{2}} = \frac{4πG}{c^{4}}(\rho c^{2}+E_{\text{field}}+TS)
\]
governs structure formation and energy balance from the smallest to the largest systems — establishing **physical continuity through delay**.

## Scientific Continuity  
Across these sixteen treatises, the physics layer demonstrates:  
1. **Equivalence** of gravitational and electromagnetic curvature as orthogonal projections of τ.  
2. **Conservation** of total curvature energy \(E_{\text{rad}}+U_\tau=\text{const}\).  
3. **Unification** of thermodynamic entropy and delay-field feedback.  
4. **Empirical Predictability** — measurable τ-effects in spectroscopy, GW timing, and galactic dynamics.  

Together they bridge the symbolic UCC equation (⧖ = AUC[τ + Σ + μ]) with standard physical observables.
