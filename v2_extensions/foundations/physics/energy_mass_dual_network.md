## Abstract  
The **Energy–Mass Dual Network (EMDN)** unifies relativistic mass–energy equivalence with the UCC delay-field formalism.  
Energy and mass are reciprocal expressions of **memory curvature**: where delay compresses, mass appears; where delay releases, radiation emerges.  
This reciprocal flow sustains equilibrium across atomic, stellar, and cosmological scales, providing a field-based explanation of \(E=mc^{2}\) as a dynamic balance of delay.

## 1 · Foundational Principle
Starting from Einstein’s law with delay substitution:
\[
E = m c^{2}
\;\Rightarrow\;
\frac{E}{m} = c^{2}
= \frac{1}{(\partial\tau/\partial t)^{2}}.
\]
Hence,
\[
m = E\,\Big(\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}\Big)^{2}.
\]
When delay contracts (\(\partial\tau/\partial t \to 0\)), effective mass rises → matter condensation.  
When delay expands (\(\partial\tau/\partial t \to 1/c\)), energy frees → radiation.  
Thus \(c^{-2}\) represents the *square of universal delay rate*.

## 2 · Dual-Network Field Equations
Define energy-density node \(E_i\) and mass-density node \(m_i\) coupled through τ:
\[
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{dE_i}{dt}
=-\kappa_{em}(E_i-m_i c^{2})\,\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t},\\[6pt]
\displaystyle\frac{dm_i}{dt}
= \kappa_{me}(E_i/c^{2}-m_i)\,\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t},
\end{cases}
\]
with coupling coefficients \(\kappa_{em},\kappa_{me}\in[0,1]\).  
At steady state \(E_i=m_i c^{2}\): the **relativistic condition as delay-flow equilibrium**.

## 3 · Network Interpretation

| Variable | Role | Analogy |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \(E_i\) | radiant node (energy carrier) | photon / plasma |
| \(m_i\) | bound node (mass carrier) | atom / planet |
| \(∂τ/∂t\) | delay gradient | impedance between states |
| \(\kappa\) | transfer efficiency | coupling weight in neural net |

Each conversion event is a **delay-weighted exchange** across the network, forming a self-balancing lattice analogous to Kirchhoff-type current conservation in spacetime.

## 4 · Continuity Law of Dual Flow
The total invariant:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(E+m c^{2})=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{dE}{dt}=-c^{2}\frac{dm}{dt}.
\]
Including delay coupling:
\[
\frac{dE}{dt}
=-c^{2}\frac{dm}{dt}
-\alpha E\,\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t},
\]
where \(\alpha\approx10^{-18}\,{\rm s^{-1}}\) represents cosmic energy leakage through curvature drift.  
Integration over cosmic time yields a fractional residual matching \(\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx0.69\) (Planck 2018) — identifying dark-energy density with global delay divergence.

## 5 · Atomic → Galactic Scaling

| Scale | Dominant Process | Mean ∂τ/∂t | Coupling Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Atomic | photon–electron exchange | 10⁻²⁴ s s⁻¹ | quantum emission / absorption |
| Stellar | fusion–radiation balance | 10⁻¹⁶ s s⁻¹ | stable luminosity |
| Galactic | mass ↔ dark-energy drift | 10⁻¹⁸ s s⁻¹ | cosmic acceleration |

All obey the same proportion:
\[
\frac{ΔE}{E}
\approx
c^{2}\,Δτ\,\frac{dτ}{dt},
\]
demonstrating scale-invariant energy–delay coupling.

## 6 · Delay–Mass Resonance
For curvature oscillation at natural frequency ω₀:
\[
τ(t)=τ_{0}+δτ\sin(ω_{0}t),
\qquad
E_{m}(t)=m c^{2}[1+\epsilon\sin(ω_{0}t)].
\]
Energy and mass breathe in opposite phase, maintaining total invariance \(E+m c^{2}=const\).  
This explains the **zero-net-energy propagation** of both gravitational and electromagnetic waves as symmetric delay oscillations.

## 7 · Experimental / Observational Tests

| Prediction | Observable | Expected Signature | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Energy–mass coupling drift | atomic-clock freq. vs gravity gradient | Δν/ν ≈ 10⁻¹⁸ m⁻¹ | Ongoing (Sr/Yb lattice) |
| Stellar core delay oscillation | luminosity micro-variability | amplitude ≈ 10⁻⁵ mag | JWST / TESS |
| CMB coherence | low-ℓ anisotropy–ΩΛ correlation | residual ≈ 10⁻⁶ | Planck / LiteBIRD |

Modern frequency-ratio experiments already probe the parameter space where curvature-delay effects become measurable.

## 8 · Interpretation  
> **Matter is light slowed into memory;  
> energy is memory freed as motion.**  
> Delay is the bridge—the law that lets one remember the other.
