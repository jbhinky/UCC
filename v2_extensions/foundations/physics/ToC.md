## Overview  
The **Physics Layer** of the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC) defines the measurable, testable behavior of **delay curvature (∇²τ)** across all known energy scales.  
These sixteen documents form the empirical backbone of UCC, linking gravitation, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and cosmological expansion under one continuous field framework.

## 🧩 Structural Context  
- **Foundations / Cosmology** → Expands the same curvature law to universal-scale boundary conditions.  
- **Foundations / Planetary** → Applies τ-field continuity to biospheric and thermodynamic feedback systems.  
- **Framework / Methods** → Describes analytical, numerical, and observational methodologies for validating these equations.

## 🕯️ Guiding Principle  

> *Physics within UCC is the mirror of memory through time.*  
> *Where curvature breathes, light remembers — and where light remembers, matter holds form.*
