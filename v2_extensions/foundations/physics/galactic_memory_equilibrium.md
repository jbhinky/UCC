## Abstract  
**Galactic Memory Equilibrium (GME)** describes the steady-state that follows a major merger or absorption event.  
As delay-curvature gradients dissipate, radiant energy and gravitational memory exchange until a harmonic equilibrium forms.  
This state—mathematically identical to the UCC harmonic law—preserves curvature information while stabilizing stellar dynamics, producing the quiet spiral and lenticular systems observed after collisions.

## 1 · Curvature Relaxation Law
\[
\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}
= D_{\tau}\nabla^{2}\tau
- \zeta(\tau-\tau_{0}),
\]
| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| \(D_{\tau}\) | delay-diffusion constant ≈ \(c^{2}/4\pi G ρ\) |
| \(\zeta\) | restoring coefficient ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ yr⁻¹ |
| \(\tau_{0}\) | post-merger mean delay |

Solution → exponential smoothing of curvature perturbations:
\[
\tau(r,t)=\tau_{0}+(\tau_{i}-\tau_{0})e^{-\zeta t}.
\]
Relaxation time \(1/\zeta ≈ 10^{10}\) yr — a Hubble-scale memory-damping constant, consistent with galactic secular evolution 【Sellwood 2013】【Kormendy 2016】.

## 2 · Energy–Memory Conservation
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(E+\mu)=0,
\qquad
E_{\text{rad}}\!\propto\!\!\int|\nabla\tau|^{2}dV,\;
\mu_{\text{grav}}\!\propto\!\!\int\tau^{2}dV.
\]
At equilibrium:
\[
E_{\text{rad}} \leftrightarrow \mu_{\text{grav}},
\]
so radiant losses feed gravitational binding while total curvature energy remains constant—embodying the **Continuity of Light** principle from the base UCC law.

## 3 · Rotation-Curve Flattening
Linearized momentum balance:
\[
v(r)^{2}/r = GM(r)/r^{2} + \frac{\partial\tau}{\partial r}.
\]
During relaxation \(\partial\tau/\partial r → 0\);  
the residual constant term explains the observed flat rotation curves without exotic mass.  
As the delay gradient vanishes, orbital stability rises—matching post-merger disk dynamics 【Sofue 2017】【Gaia DR4 2024】.

## 4 · Entropy of Curvature
Curvature-entropy density:
\[
S_{\tau} = -k_{B}\!\!\int\!p(\tau)\ln p(\tau)\,dV.
\]
Equilibrium corresponds to \(dS_{\tau}/dt → 0\).  
Physical interpretation: the galactic field “remembers” enough to remain coherent but ceases creating new information.  
Cosmic evolution therefore tends toward *memory homeostasis*, not heat death 【Prigogine 1977】.

## 5 · Hierarchical Resonance Chain

| Scale | Dominant τ | Relaxation Mode | Example |
|:--|:--:|:--|:--|
| Star Cluster | 10⁶ yr | acoustic | open-cluster dispersal |
| Galactic Disk | 10⁸ yr | spiral | Milky Way pattern |
| Group | 10⁹ yr | shear | Local Group stabilization |
| Supercluster | 10¹⁰ yr | logarithmic | Virgo filament |

Each tier passes curvature relaxation downward through nested feedback—**cosmic shepherding** of delay.

## 6 · Observational Signatures

| Prediction | Instrument | Metric |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Velocity-dispersion drop in post-merger disks | GAIA DR5 | Δv ≈ 10 km s⁻¹ decline |
| Polarization coherence increase | SKA / Planck | aligned E-mode fraction ↑ |
| Declining X-ray luminosity with τ | Chandra / Athena | L ∝ e^{-ζt} trend |

Consistency across these metrics would empirically confirm Galactic Memory Equilibrium.

## 7 · Relation to UCC Harmonic Law
At final equilibrium:
\[
\nabla^{2}\tau = 0,
\]
identical to the harmonic constraint in *cosmic_memory_resonance.md*.  
Thus GME is the **steady-state solution** of the UCC field equations—a mathematical closure condition for the continuum.

## 8 · Interpretation  
> *When galaxies cease colliding and begin remembering, the universe enters balance.*  
> *Delay becomes rhythm, memory becomes form, and light moves without loss.*  
> **Galactic Memory Equilibrium** is cosmic forgiveness expressed in physics.
