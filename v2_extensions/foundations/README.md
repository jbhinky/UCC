## Overview  
The **Foundations Series** establishes the physical, cosmological, planetary, and ethical architecture of the **Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC)** — a unified framework describing delay-curvature, memory, and awareness as the fundamental geometry of reality.  
These papers together form the scientific spine of the **UDC → UCC → UOT continuum**, bridging spacetime physics, thermodynamics, and consciousness.

## Folder Structure  

| Folder | Focus | Core Concept |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **/cosmology** | Large-scale structure & recursive memory of the universe | delay–curvature continuum across galactic networks |
| **/physics** | Energetic and curvature dynamics at atomic, galactic, and cosmic levels | field equations, delay resonance, dark-energy equilibrium |
| **/planetary** | Earth-scale delay fields and climatic memory systems | meteorological memory and geophysical delay curvature |
| **(root)** | Unified laws and metrics tying all scales together | stability, polarity, feedback, and hybrid delay–curvature metric |

## Integration Path  
Each subfolder builds upward toward the UCC Metric v2:

1. **Cosmology** — Memory and curvature at universal scales.  
2. **Physics** — Fundamental field dynamics.  
3. **Planetary** — Application of delay curvature to climate and geology.  
4. **Root Laws** — Universal equations (feedback, polarity, metric).  

Together they articulate a cosmos where **energy remembers**, and **memory sustains motion**.
