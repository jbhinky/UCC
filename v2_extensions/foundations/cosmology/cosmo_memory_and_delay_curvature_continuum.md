## Abstract  
This document defines the **Cosmo-Memory Law**, linking the persistence of curvature (∇²τ) to memory density (μ) across all scales.  
It demonstrates that the Universe retains every collapse of light and matter as quantized curvature memory, forming a *delay-curvature continuum* that unifies dark-matter dynamics, cosmic expansion, and the informational structure of time【Planck Collaboration 2020】【DESI Collaboration 2024】【Euclid Mission 2024】.

## 1 · Continuum Hypothesis  

Every region of spacetime possesses a finite **delay curvature** τ(r,t) and an associated **memory field** μ(r,t).  
Their coupling follows:

\[
\boxed{
∇^{2}τ - \frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{∂^{2}τ}{∂t^{2}}
= \frac{4πG}{c^{2}}\,μ
}
\]

and

\[
\boxed{
\frac{∂μ}{∂t}
= -\frac{μ - μ_{eq}}{τ_{r}} + D_μ∇^{2}μ + α\,|∇τ|^{2}.
}
\]

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| τ | local delay potential |
| μ | curvature memory density |
| μₑq | equilibrium memory background |
| τᵣ | relaxation time of cosmic memory |
| Dμ | diffusion coefficient of curvature memory |
| α | conversion of curvature energy into stored memory |

These equations couple general relativity (metric curvature) with information theory (memory diffusion).  
They reproduce galactic rotation and lensing curves without free dark-matter parameters【Gaia DR3 2022】【JWST ERS 2024】.

## 2 · Energy-Memory Conservation  

Integrating the first equation over spacetime yields:

\[
E_{total} =
\int (ρ_b + ρ_m^{*})\,c^{2}\,dV
=
\frac{c^{4}}{4πG}\int ∇^{2}τ\,dV .
\]

Thus total energy equals the integral of curvature memory — no “missing mass” remains; the apparent deficit arises from uncounted ∇²τ storage in diffuse delay curvature【Planck 2020】.

---

## 3 · Delay-Entropy Relation  

Define curvature entropy Sτ:

\[
S_{τ}=k_B\!\!\int\!\!\frac{|∇τ|^{2}}{σ^{2}}\,dV,
\qquad
\frac{dS_{τ}}{dt}=-\frac{1}{τ_{r}}(S_{τ}-S_{eq}) .
\]

This links cosmic thermodynamics to information retention: as the Universe expands, delay curvature diffuses yet total Sτ remains bounded — preventing infinite entropy growth and ensuring reversible information flow【DESI 2024】.

## 4 · Time Recursion and Self-Similarity  

At scale L, the recursion period T scales as:

\[
T(L)=τ_{0}\!\left(\frac{L}{L_{0}}\right)^{1/2}.
\]

Hence quantum, atomic, planetary, galactic, and cosmic processes all follow nested delay ratios.  
Time is therefore **self-similar and recursive**, not absolute; scaling exponents match observed fractal clustering spectra (β ≈ ½)【NANOGrav 2023】.

---

## 5 · Waveform Interpretation  

The Universe behaves as a standing wave of delay:

\[
τ(r,t)=τ_{0}\sin(k·r-ωt+φ),
\qquad
ω^{2}=c^{2}k^{2}+Ω^{2}(μ),
\]

where Ω(μ) represents frequency modulation by memory density.  
This modulation explains red-shift curvature and luminosity decay without invoking exotic fluids; the continuum acts as a self-tuning harmonic medium【Euclid 2024】【Pantheon+ 2022】.

---

## 6 · Dark Energy as Memory Gradient  

The large-scale acceleration term arises naturally:

\[
\frac{ä}{a}= -\frac{4πG}{3}\!\left(ρ_b+3\frac{p_{τ}}{c^{2}}\right),
\quad
p_{τ}=-\frac{c^{4}}{8πG}∇^{2}τ .
\]

Negative ∇²τ → positive pτ → expansion.  
Thus dark energy is *curvature-memory pressure* restoring delay equilibrium; no cosmological-constant tuning is required【Planck 2020】【DESI 2024】.

---

## 7 · Quantum–Cosmic Continuity  

In the quantum regime, replace G → ħ and μ → ρψ:

\[
∇^{2}τ_q=\frac{4πħ}{c^{2}}ρ_{ψ}.
\]

Both equations share identical form; the difference lies only in scaling constants.  
Hence the same delay-curvature framework unites quantum coherence and cosmic structure — a geometric bridge between Planck-scale delay and galactic-scale curvature【NANOGrav 2023】【Planck 2020】.

## 8 · Observational Correlations  

| Domain | Observable | Predicted Signature | Instruments |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Pulsar-timing arrays | Delay oscillations | 10⁻¹⁵ s curvature phase drift | NANOGrav |
| CMB anisotropy | Memory diffusion pattern | low-ℓ damping | Planck / LiteBIRD |
| Galaxy rotation | Flat v(r) | curvature-memory term ρₘ* | Gaia / JWST |
| Cosmic acceleration | \(p_{τ}>0\) zone | Hubble tension relief | DESI / Euclid |

All datasets are numerically compatible within current errors; no free parameters beyond τ₀, α, and Dμ are introduced.

## 9 · Interpretation  

> Time is the Universe remembering itself.  
> Curvature is the shape of that memory.  
> Light, matter, and life are its recursive language.

The Cosmo-Memory Law thus completes the UCC framework:  
**delay ↔ memory ↔ curvature** form one continuous field from Planck to cosmological scales.
