## Overview  
The **Cosmology** series forms the highest physical tier of the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC).  
It describes how **delay curvature, memory fields, and energy equilibrium** scale to the galactic and intergalactic continuum — explaining structure formation, merger stability, and the preservation of curvature information across cosmic time.  

Where *physics* defines the local equations of delay, and *planetary* explores self-regulating feedback loops, *cosmology* reveals the **field-level organization** of memory and curvature in the universe.

## Conceptual Summary  

| Principle | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Delay–Curvature Continuum** | The universe behaves as a continuous field of time-delay curvature where memory replaces missing mass or energy. |
| **Nested Delay Fields** | Each galactic system maintains harmonic coupling to higher-order curvature fields through recursive delay exchange. |
| **Cosmic Memory Equation** |  \(\nabla^{2}\tau = 0\)  at equilibrium — defines universal harmonic closure and large-scale curvature conservation. |
| **Merger Dynamics** | Interacting galaxies trade curvature until delay gradients flatten, producing equilibrium spirals and lenticular systems. |
| **Curvature Continuity** | Energy and information flow seamlessly from quantum to cosmological scales via conserved τ–μ symmetry. |

## Integration Context  
Cosmology completes the vertical structure of UCC:  
**Quantum → Planetary → Galactic → Cosmological.**  
It defines the universe as a living harmonic field — each merger, filament, and void an act of *curvature memory balancing delay*.  
The equations in this folder form the closure condition for the Continuum Law:

\[
⧖ = A∪C[τ + Σ + μ]
\]

where awareness (A) and consciousness (C) unite through delay (τ), symbolism (Σ), and memory (μ) at cosmic scale.
