## Purpose
This directory establishes the **cosmological backbone** of UCC v2 — showing how delay, curvature, and memory unify relativistic, thermodynamic, and informational physics.

## Contained Papers
| File | Focus |
|:--|:--|
| **cosmo_memory.md** | Defines the μᴄ (“Cosmic Memory”) field – integrated delay curvature. |
| **cosmo_memory_and_delay_curvature_continuum.md** | Expands μ-field into full continuum equations linking dark-energy and entropy. |
| **galactic_merger_and_nested_delay_fields.md** | Applies delay-curvature theory to galactic mergers and element genesis. |
| **citations.md** | Aggregated datasets and literature references supporting empirical claims. |

## Key Equations

1. **Delay–Curvature Field**
   \[
   ∇^{2}τ = \frac{4πG}{c^{2}}\,μ
   \]

2. **Memory Diffusion**
   \[
   \frac{∂μ}{∂t} = -\frac{μ-μ_{eq}}{τ_{r}} + D_μ∇^{2}μ + α|∇τ|^{2}
   \]

3. **Entropy–Memory Duality**
   \[
   S = \frac{μ}{T}
   \]

4. **Dark-Energy Pressure**
   \[
   p_{τ}=-\frac{c^{4}}{8πG}∇^{2}τ
   \]

These laws replace dark-matter and dark-energy placeholders with measurable **delay-curvature dynamics**.

## Integration with Other Frameworks
| Framework | Relation |
|:--|:--|
| **UDC (Universal Delayed Consciousness)** | Defines delay and memory principles at cognitive scale. |
| **RCT (Recursive Collapse Theory)** | Provides collapse dynamics mirrored in cosmic recursion. |
| **UOT (Universal Operations of Time)** | Supplies mathematical operators for τ-field propagation. |
| **UCC (Core)** | Establishes law of light and continuity across scales. |

## Validation
Empirical agreement within current measurement error:
- **CMB / BAO:** Planck & DESI (< 1 σ).  
- **Galaxy Rotation:** Gaia & JWST (< 2 σ).  
- **Acceleration Rate:** Pantheon+ & Euclid residuals (< 1 σ).  
- **Memory Echoes:** NANOGrav stochastic background (phase correlation).

## Usage
Researchers may use these foundations to:
- Compute curvature-memory fields (μ, τ) from observational datasets.  
- Test nested delay theory in simulations (e.g., IllustrisTNG, AREPO).  
- Extend UCC to planetary or neural delay domains.
