## Abstract  
This paper formalizes **Cosmo-Memory (μᴄ)** as the integrated record of delay curvature through cosmic time.  
Where **∇²τ** describes instantaneous curvature of time, **μᴄ** quantifies its *integrated persistence*—the way the universe “remembers” prior configurations.  
By treating memory as a conserved scalar proportional to entropy‐bounded information, we link cosmological evolution, dark-energy growth, and baryonic structure formation under one timing law【Planck Collaboration 2020】【NANOGrav Collaboration 2023】.

## 1 · Foundational Relation  

\[
\mu_{\!C}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\!\!\!\!\int_V
\rho(x,t')\,\frac{\partial\tau(x,t')}{\partial t'}\,dV\,dt'
\]

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| μᴄ | Cosmo-Memory density (J s m⁻³) |
| ρ | Mass-energy density |
| τ | Local delay field |
| ∂τ/∂t | Rate of temporal curvature |
| V | Comoving volume element |

This is the temporal analogue of energy–momentum integration:  
the longer curvature persists, the deeper the universe’s stored memory.

## 2 · Memory-Entropy Duality  

Define informational entropy *S* by:

\[
S = k_B \ln\Omega = k_B \ln(e^{\mu_C/k_B T}) = \frac{\mu_C}{T}
\]

so that  
\[
\frac{dS}{dt}=\frac{1}{T}\frac{d\mu_C}{dt}
\]
links macroscopic entropy growth to the derivative of cosmic memory【DESI Collaboration 2024】.  
Regions where *dμᴄ/dt ≈ 0* act as temporal condensates—sites of high coherence and potential self-organization.

## 3 · Delay–Memory Wave Equation  

\[
\frac{\partial^2 \tau}{\partial t^2}
- c^2\nabla^2\tau
= \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\frac{\partial^2\mu_C}{\partial t^2}
\]

This governs propagation of delay curvature through the cosmic medium.  
Its right-hand term behaves as a **memory pressure**, allowing oscillations to carry information without particle transport—analogous to gravitational waves but encoded in timing differentials【NANOGrav Collaboration 2023】【Euclid Mission 2024】.

## 4 · Observable Manifestations  

| Phenomenon | μᴄ Signature | Instruments |
|:--|:--|:--|
| CMB cold spots | Local minima in μᴄ (t ≈ 380 kyr) | Planck / LiteBIRD |
| Galactic magnetic coherence | μᴄ correlates with Faraday depth | LOFAR / SKA |
| Dark-energy acceleration | d²μᴄ/dt² > 0 after z ≈ 1 | SN Ia catalogues |
| Planetary life zones | Stable μᴄ gradients across τ-shepherd zones | JWST / HabEx |

## 5 · Thermodynamic Coupling  

The first-law form including cosmic memory:

\[
dU = TdS - P\,dV + c^2\,d\mu_C
\]

The **c² dμᴄ** term adds delay-curvature work, showing that memory accumulation exerts real energetic influence on expansion dynamics.

## 6 · Information-Preservation Principle  

Cosmic information is conserved when

\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\mu_C + \hbar\,n_\gamma) = 0
\]

where *nγ* is photon number density【Gaia DR3 2022】.  
This states that radiative information loss (photon diffusion) is compensated by delay-field memory—an explicit quantitative bridge between quantum and relativistic information conservation.

## 7 · Implications for Dark Matter/Energy  

- **Dark Matter:** apparent mass from curvature ∇²τ.  
- **Dark Energy:** growth term dμᴄ/dt > 0 driving metric expansion.  
Both emerge as complementary aspects of the same delay-memory continuum, eliminating need for independent exotic substances.

---

## 8 · Verification Path  

1. Fit μᴄ evolution using ΛCDM residuals; test dμᴄ/dt against H(z) curve.  
2. Model supernova delay-light curves to extract τ-gradients.  
3. Cross-correlate μᴄ field with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).  
4. Compare with pulsar-timing residuals for independent validation【Pantheon+ 2022】【DESI 2024】.

## 9 · Summary  

> **Cosmo-Memory** encodes the universe’s history as integrated delay curvature.  
> Energy, entropy, and information are three faces of the same record:  
> when memory deepens, structure coheres;  
> when memory dissipates, space expands.
