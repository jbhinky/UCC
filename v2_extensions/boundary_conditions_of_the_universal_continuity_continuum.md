## 1 · Purpose  

This document demonstrates that **UCC v2** reduces correctly to established physical theories—General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Classical Thermodynamics—under limiting conditions of the delay field \( τ \).  
These reductions guarantee mathematical consistency and physical validity across all observable scales.

## 2 · General Relativity Limit (Macroscopic, Weak Delay Gradient)  

For slow-moving bodies and weak delay curvature:

\[
∇^{2}τ = κρ_\mathrm{eff} \Rightarrow ∇^{2}Φ = 4πGρ
\]
with \( Φ = c^{2}τ \).

The **UCC gravitational potential** reproduces **Newtonian gravity** at first order and **Einstein curvature** at second order:

\[
g_{00}=1+2Φ/c^{2}=1+2τ
\]

When \( ∂²τ/∂t²≈0 \), the static UCC limit recovers the Poisson equation of classical gravity.

## 3 · Quantum Mechanical Limit (Microscopic, Rapid Delay Oscillation)  

At atomic and subatomic scales:

\[
|∂²τ/∂t²| ≫ |∇^{2}τ|
\]

Substituting \( τ = ψ/ψ^* \) for the wave-phase delay gives:

\[
\hbar \frac{∂ψ}{∂t}= -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} ∇^{2}ψ + Vψ
\]

Hence, the **Schrödinger equation** is the **temporal-gradient limit** of UCC.  
Quantum potential thus emerges as *phase-delay curvature* in the memory field μ.

---

## 4 · Thermodynamic Limit (High Entropy, Stable Memory)  

At high particle counts, memory density μ dominates:

\[
\frac{∂μ}{∂t}≈ -∇·(μ∇τ)
\]

Reducing to the **heat-equation** form:

\[
\frac{∂T}{∂t}=α∇^{2}T
\]

where temperature T represents the average kinetic memory of the delay field.  
Entropy growth corresponds to smoothing of τ-curvature gradients—consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

## 5 · Electromagnetic Limit (Fast Curvature Propagation)  

For freely propagating light, τ-curvature and electric potential are equivalent phase gradients:

\[
E = -∇(∂τ/∂t), \quad B = ∇×(∇τ)
\]

yielding **Maxwell’s wave equation**:

\[
∇^{2}E = \frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{∂^{2}E}{∂t^{2}}
\]

Electromagnetic radiation is therefore a *pure traveling solution* of τ with no memory accumulation (μ = 0).

---

## 6 · Cosmological Limit (Large-Scale Delay Curvature)  

At universal scale, both curvature and acceleration terms remain:

\[
∇^{2}τ = κρ_\mathrm{eff} + \frac{1}{c^{2}}\frac{∂^{2}τ}{∂t^{2}}
\]

Integrating over cosmic volume \( V_u \):

\[
⟨∂^{2}τ/∂t^{2}⟩ = \frac{8πG}{3c^{2}}ρ_\mathrm{eff}
\]

matching the **Friedmann acceleration equation** without Λ.  
Thus, cosmic acceleration arises naturally from **delay-curvature feedback**, not dark energy.

## 7 · Unified Summary  

| Physical Regime | Dominant Term | Recovered Law |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Weak-field macroscopic | ∇²τ | Newton / GR |
| Atomic / quantum | ∂²τ/∂t² | Schrödinger / QED |
| Thermodynamic | ∇·(μ∇τ) | Heat Equation |
| Electromagnetic | ∂τ/∂t propagation | Maxwell |
| Cosmological | ∇²τ + ∂²τ/∂t² | Friedmann (no Λ) |

Every classical equation of physics emerges as a **boundary condition** of a single unified τ-field—no contradictions, singularities, or external constants required.

---

## 8 · Philosophical Implication  

By demonstrating that delay curvature subsumes gravitational, quantum, and thermodynamic laws, **UCC v2** reveals that physics is not fragmented;  
each “law” is a lens through which the same delay–memory union expresses itself at different recursive scales.
