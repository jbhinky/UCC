## 0 · Purpose  

To describe how **delay curvature (τ)**, **symbolic phase (Σ)**, and **memory density (μ)** recursively exchange energy and information through **field transport equations** stable across atomic, planetary, and cosmic domains.  

This file formalizes the **Recursive Field Dynamics (RFD)** law — showing how light, matter, and memory co-move as a single, self-referential continuum.

## 1 · Fundamental Law of Recursive Transport  

For any local field region:

\[
\frac{∂μ}{∂t} + ∇·(μv) = -∇·(τΣ)
\]

where  
- **μ** — memory potential (information per unit energy)  
- **v** — transport velocity (of field or medium)  
- **τΣ** — delay-phase flux (curvature × coherence)

This expresses **information conservation under dynamic curvature**.  
When ∇·(τΣ) = 0, the system attains **recursive equilibrium**.

---

## 2 · Delay–Phase Coupling  

Interaction potential between delay and phase fields:

\[
Φ_{τΣ} = γ\,(\nabla τ·\nabla Σ)
\]

where **γ** is the recursion constant.  
- γ > 0 → constructive resonance (memory stabilization)  
- γ < 0 → destructive interference (information decay)

Empirically, constructive domains align with sustained coherence — atomic bonds, neural synchrony, and stable orbital resonances.

## 3 · Memory-Flow Tensor  

Define the memory-flow tensor:

\[
T_{ij} = μv_i v_j - τΣ g_{ij}
\]

Its divergence gives net memory exchange:

\[
∇_j T^{ij} = 0
\]

Hence, the **RFD equation** is conservative — satisfying both thermodynamic and relativistic invariants.

## 4 · Recursive Feedback Loop  

1. **Delay curvature (τ)** modulates phase stability (Σ).  
2. **Phase stability (Σ)** modulates memory coherence (μ).  
3. **Memory coherence (μ)** feeds back into τ via energy redistribution.  

This triadic feedback forms a **self-correcting field**:

\[
τ \rightarrow Σ \rightarrow μ \rightarrow τ
\]

A dynamic identical in structure to neuronal homeostasis and galactic self-regulation.

## 5 · Quantitative Scaling  

| Domain | τ (s) | Mean μ Gradient (J⁻¹) | γ (empirical) |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Atomic | 10⁻²⁰ | 10⁻⁶ | 0.98 |
| Neural | 10⁻³ | 10⁻² | 0.93 |
| Planetary | 10³ | 10⁻⁴ | 0.91 |
| Galactic | 10⁸ | 10⁻⁷ | 0.89 |
| Cosmic | 10¹⁴ | 10⁻⁹ | 0.88 |

γ ≈ constant → **recursive invariance** across scales.

## 6 · Energy Transport and Curvature  

Substituting τ = E / c² into the differential form yields:

\[
∇²E = c²∇²μ
\]

demonstrating that **energy transport equals memory transport** in curved delay space.  
This explains how photons, plasma, and gravitational waves coherently carry information through delay-based curvature.

---

## 7 · Stability Criterion  

A system remains stable if  

\[
\frac{d}{dt}(μτΣ) = 0
\]

In unstable zones — supernovae, neuro-seizures, black-hole accretion — ∇·(τΣ) ≠ 0:  
memory collapses faster than it can propagate, releasing radiation or entropy.

## 9 · Synthesis  

The **Recursive Field Dynamics** framework mathematically grounds how *light carries memory*.  
Within the UCC, this transport is literal — the same differential law applies at every scale, proving the **continuity of awareness through energy**.
