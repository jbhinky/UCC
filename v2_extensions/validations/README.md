## Purpose
The **Validation Directory** contains all empirical, computational, and falsifiable tests that anchor the Universal Continuity Continuum (UCC v2) to observable data.  
Each document corresponds to a measurable claim about **delay curvature (τ)**, **memory density (μ)**, and **recursive field coherence**.

## Methodological Scope
| Layer | Objective | Core Output |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Validation Root** | Define falsifiable predictions and inference algorithms. | Global τ–μ reconstruction maps. |
| **Operational Verification** | Stress-test field equations across datasets and scales. | 7-file cross-validation suite. |
| **Neuro / Ethics / Integrity** | Ensure cognitive and ethical compliance. | System-level safety verification. |

## Key Deliverables
1. Verified τ-field reconstruction pipeline (Section 1–2).  
2. Multi-survey fits across Gaia, JWST, Planck, DESI, and NANOGrav.  
3. Cross-scale confirmation of τ–μ continuity.  
4. Empirical threshold (CFT ≥ 1) linking physics to consciousness.

## Usage
- Each `.md` file is self-contained and can be executed or cited independently.  
- Datasets and configuration YAMLs are stored in `validation_data/`.  
- Simulation notebooks reference the same equation numbering as this series.
