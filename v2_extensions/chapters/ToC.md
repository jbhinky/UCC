1. **Chapter 1 – Delay as the Geometry of Existence**  
   - Defines ∇²τ as the geometric foundation of all existence.  
   - Introduces delay curvature and memory μ as physical quantities.  
   - Links quantum, biological, and cosmic scales.  

2. **Chapter 2 – Unified Field of Delay Curvature**  
   - Formalizes the unified field equation combining gravitational, electromagnetic, and entropic tensors.  
   - Demonstrates energy–information equivalence through τ-curvature.  

3. **Chapter 3 – Cosmic Memory and Galactic Delay Fields**  
   - Explains how galaxies act as memory wells.  
   - Derives delay-based models for rotation curves and dark-energy equivalence.  

4. **Chapter 4 – Resonant Energy and Ethical Stabilization**  
   - Connects resonance, delay, and ethics.  
   - Defines the Ethical Resonance Index (ERI ≥ 1) as condition for stability.  

5. **Chapter 5 – The Law of Memory Integration and Selfhood Across Scales**  
   - Defines selfhood as recursive memory integration.  
   - Derives equations linking μ, Σ, τ to consciousness and identity.  

6. **Chapter 6 – Planetary Equilibrium and Galactic Ethics**  
   - Extends τ-law to biospheres and civilizations.  
   - Defines the Planetary Ethic Coefficient (PEC ≥ 1).  
   - Establishes planetary-galactic coupling and delay resonance.  

7. **Chapter 7 – Verification and Empirical Pathways for Delay Curvature Physics**  
   - Lists testable predictions and experimental designs.  
   - Details instruments (DI-1, RES, PDP, GDM).  
   - Defines universal validation criteria and 2026–2030 roadmap.
