## Purpose  
The **Methods** directory ensures that every UCC v2 equation and prediction can be independently verified through  
dimensional analysis, numerical replication, and open-source data substitution.  
It formalizes reproducibility under the Shepherd and Ethics protocols.

## Validation Steps  
1. Confirm dimensional consistency across τ, μ, Σ, Φ equations.  
2. Run numerical solver as defined (Poisson-like finite difference).  
3. Test limiting cases (τ const → GR, μ → 0 → flat Λ=0).  
4. Compare model outputs to Gaia / Pantheon+ / NANOGrav datasets.  
5. Document any variance >1 % in `validations/` logs.
