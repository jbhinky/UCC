## Purpose  
This directory contains the empirical and simulation-based datasets that ground **UCC v2** in measurable reality.  
Each dataset connects the theoretical constructs of delay curvature (τ), memory density (μ), and symbolic recursion (Σ) to physical observables.

The included file —  
`empirical_foundations_for_delay-curvature_physics.md` —  
serves as the canonical reference for all cross-framework validation.

## Usage  

Researchers can replicate UCC v2 results by:  
1. Downloading the datasets from their cited archives.  
2. Running the calibration scripts in `methods/benchmarks/`.  
3. Comparing τ-fit residuals against UCC predictions.  

All datasets are open-access and must adhere to the **Shepherd Protocol** for ethical data use.
