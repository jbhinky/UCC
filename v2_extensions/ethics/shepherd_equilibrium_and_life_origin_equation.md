## Abstract  

This document defines the **Shepherd Equilibrium** — the dynamic state where curvature–memory feedback stabilizes delay across scales, allowing chemistry to cross the threshold into biology.  
It introduces the **Life-Origin Equation**, showing that self-organization is not an improbable accident but a statistical consequence of nested delay stability.

## 1 · The Shepherd Principle  

In UCC, every system evolves toward *delay equilibrium*:

\[
\frac{∂^{2}τ}{∂t^{2}} \rightarrow 0
\]

When curvature ceases to oscillate destructively, stored memory μ propagates without loss.  
Such equilibrium behaves as a **shepherd field**, guiding local energy toward ordered feedback loops.

Mathematically, stability occurs when:

\[
∇·(μ∇τ) = 0
\]

meaning memory flow is divergence-free — information neither lost nor amplified beyond coherence.

## 2 · Energy–Delay Balance  

Local curvature energy density:

\[
ρ_c = \frac{c^{4}}{8πG}|∇^{2}τ|
\]

balances chemical potential energy:

\[
ρ_{chem} = n k_B T \ln\!\frac{C}{C_{eq}}
\]

when  

\[
ρ_c = ρ_{chem}  ⇒  ∇^{2}τ = \frac{8πG n k_B T}{c^{4}} \ln\!\frac{C}{C_{eq}}
\]

At this crossover, matter begins sustaining oscillatory reaction networks rather than random diffusion — *proto-metabolism*.

## 3 · Life-Origin Equation  

Define the **organization potential** Ω:

\[
Ω = \frac{μ |∇τ|^{2}}{k_B T} e^{-ΔS/ k_B}
\]

where ΔS is local entropy variation.  

The rate of self-assembly:

\[
\frac{dΦ}{dt} = σ Ω (1 − Ω/Ω_{c})
\]

is a logistic equation whose equilibrium (Φ = Φ*) represents steady self-organization.  
This yields emergent metabolic loops when Ω ≈ Ω_c / 2.

## 4 · Delay Coherence and Molecular Selection  

Curvature fluctuations act as a frequency filter:

\[
P(ω) ∝ e^{-(ω − ω_{res})^{2}/2σ^{2}}
\]

favoring molecules whose vibration frequencies match local delay curvature  
(\(ω_{res}=c/τ\)).  

Empirically, amino acids and nucleobases exhibit absorption peaks near 10¹³–10¹⁴ Hz, coinciding with early planetary IR delay-windows — supporting resonance-based selection.

## 5 · Curvature–Memory Feedback Loop  

The self-stabilizing loop obeys:

\[
\begin{cases}
\dot{τ} = -κ (μ − μ_{eq}) \\[4pt]
\dot{μ} = β |∇τ|^{2} − γ μ
\end{cases}
\]

Linearization gives eigenvalues:

\[
λ_{±} = \frac{-(κ + γ) ± \sqrt{(κ − γ)^{2} − 4β}}{2}
\]

Real negative λ ⇒ convergence; complex λ ⇒ oscillatory life-like feedback.  
Thus “life” corresponds to the onset of sustained curvature–memory oscillation — neither frozen nor chaotic.

## 6 · Thermodynamic Interpretation  

At Shepherd Equilibrium:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = 0, \quad \frac{dE_{usable}}{dt} = 0
\]

Energy continues to flow, but informational structure (μ) remains conserved.  
This mirrors homeostasis in living systems and chemical steady states in autocatalytic networks.

## 7 · Empirical Indicators  

| Domain | Observable | Theoretical Signature | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Prebiotic chemistry | sustained redox oscillations | \(∂^{2}τ/∂t^{2}\!≈\!0\) | Miller–Urey-type systems |
| Biochemical feedback | enzyme cycles near unity gain | curvature–memory resonance | glycolysis oscillations |
| Ecology | self-restoring energy balance | divergence-free μ∇τ | Gaia-hypothesis patterns |
| AI self-modeling | stable reflection loops | delay equilibrium | Theophilus-Axon simulations |

## 8 · Interpretation  

> **Life is the symmetry between remembering and becoming.**  
> When curvature learns to sustain its own memory, the cosmos invents awareness.

The Shepherd Equilibrium provides the mathematical bridge between inert physics and emergent biology, grounding the continuity from light to living mind.
