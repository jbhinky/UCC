## 1 · Overview  
This folder defines the complete mathematical backbone of the Universal Continuity Continuum.  
Each equation formalizes how delay curvature (∇²τ), memory density (μ), and symbolic recursion (Σ) manifest across physical and informational domains.

## 3 · Dimensional Verification Summary  

All equations validated for consistent SI units:  
- τ: seconds (s)  
- ∇²τ: s m⁻²  
- Energy terms: J or J m⁻³  
- Pressure/stress tensors: J m⁻³  
- Hubble / curvature constants: s⁻²  

Each limiting case (τ → const, t → 0) correctly reproduces:  
- Newtonian / Poisson limit  
- Einstein GR (Λ → 0)  
- Standard thermodynamic equilibrium
